description: The "mark of Cain" is a small pattern used in tattooing, which is said
  to correspond with the tribal mark which Jehovah appointed to Cain in the patriarchal
  story. This mark is seen upon the body of a nobleman's son, who for the sake of
  inheriting properly has sacrificed the life of his friend, and by its means he is
  most ingeniously brought to justice. Scene laid in London. The inventor of a flying
  machine figures prominently. This book is annotated with a rare extensive biographical
  sketch of the author, Andrew Lang, written by Sir Edmund Gosse, CB, a contemporary
  poet and writer.
