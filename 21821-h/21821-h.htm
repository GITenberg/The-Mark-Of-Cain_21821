      CHAPTER I.&mdash;A Tale of Two Clubs.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Such arts the gods who dwell on high
     Have given to the Greek."&mdash;<i>Lays of Ancient Rome.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      In the Strangers' Room of the Olympic Club the air was thick with
      tobacco-smoke, and, despite the bitter cold outside, the temperature was
      uncomfortably high. Dinner was over, and the guests, broken up into little
      groups, were chattering noisily. No one had yet given any sign of
      departing: no one had offered a welcome apology for the need of catching
      an evening train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the civilized custom which permits women to dine in the presence
      of the greedier sex is the proudest conquest of Culture. Were it not for
      the excuse of "joining the ladies," dinner-parties (Like the congregations
      in Heaven, as described in the hymn) would "ne'er break up," and suppers
      (like Sabbaths, on the same authority) would never end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang it all, will the fellows <i>never</i> go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      So thought Maitland, of St. Gatien's, the founder of the feast. The
      inhospitable reflections which we have recorded had all been passing
      through his brain as he rather moodily watched the twenty guests he had
      been feeding&mdash;one can hardly say entertaining. It was a "duty dinner"
      he had been giving&mdash;almost everything Maitland did was done from a
      sense of duty&mdash;yet he scarcely appeared to be reaping the reward of
      an approving conscience. His acquaintances, laughing and gossipping round
      the half-empty wine-glasses, the olives, the scattered fruit, and "the
      ashes of the weeds of their delight," gave themselves no concern about the
      weary host. Even at his own party, as in life generally, Maitland felt
      like an outsider. He wakened from his reverie as a strong hand was laid
      lightly on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Maitland," said a man sitting down beside him, "what have <i>you</i>
      been doing this long time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have I been doing, Barton?" Maitland answered. "Oh, I have been
      reflecting on the choice of a life, and trying to humanize myself! Bielby
      says I have not enough human nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bielby is quite right; he is the most judicious of college dons and
      father-confessors, old man. And how long do you mean to remain his pupil
      and penitent? And how is the pothouse getting on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank Barton, the speaker, had been at school with Maitland, and ever
      since, at college and in life, had bullied, teased, and befriended him.
      Barton was a big young man, with great thews and sinews, and a broad,
      breast beneath his broadcloth and wide shirt-front. He was blonde,
      prematurely bald, with an aquiline commanding nose, keen, merry blue eyes,
      and a short, fair beard. He had taken a medical as well as other degrees
      at the University; he had studied at Vienna and Paris; he was even what
      Captain Costigan styles "a scoientific cyarkter." He had written learnedly
      in various Proceedings of erudite societies; he had made a cruise in a
      man-of-war, a scientific expedition; and his <i>Les Tatouages, Étude
      Médico-Lêgale</i>, published in Paris, had been commended by the highest
      authorities. Yet, from some whim of philanthropy, he had not a home and
      practice in Cavendish Square, but dwelt and labored in Chelsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is your pothouse getting on?" he asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The pothouse? Oh, the <i>Hit or Miss</i> you mean? Well, I'm afraid it's
      not very successful I took the lease of it, you know, partly by way of
      doing some good in a practical kind of way. The working men at the
      waterside won't go to clubs, where there is nothing but coffee to drink,
      and little but tracts to read. I thought if I gave them sound beer, and
      looked in among them now and then of an evening, I might help to civilize
      them a bit, like that fellow who kept the Thieves' Club in the East End.
      And then I fancied they might help to make <i>me</i> a little more human.
      But it does not seem quite to succeed. I fear I am a born wet blanket But
      the idea is good. Mrs. St. John Delo-raine quite agrees with me about <i>that</i>.
      And she is a high authority."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. St. John Deloraine? I've heard of her. She is a lively widow, isn't
      she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a practical philanthropist," answered Maitland, flushing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty, too, I have been told?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; she is 'conveniently handsome,' as Izaak Walton says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Maitland, here's a chance to humanize you. Why don't you ask her
      to marry you? Pretty and philanthropic and rich&mdash;what better would
      you ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish everyone wouldn't bother a man to marry," Maitland replied
      testily, and turning red in his peculiar manner; for his complexion was
      pale and unwholesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a queer chap you are, Maitland; what's the matter with you? Here you
      are, young, entirely without encumbrances, as the advertisements say, no
      relations to worry you, with plenty of money, let alone what you make by
      writing, and yet you are not happy. What is the matter with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you should know best What's the good of your being a doctor, and
      acquainted all these years with my moral and physical constitution (what
      there is of it), if you can't tell what's the nature of my complaint?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't diagnose many cases like yours, old boy, down by the side of the
      water, among the hardy patients of Mundy &amp; Barton, general
      practitioners. There is plenty of human nature <i>there!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you mean to stay there with Mundy much longer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know. A fellow is really doing some good, and it is a
      splendid practice for mastering surgery. They are always falling off
      roofs, or having weights fall on them, or getting jammed between barges,
      or kicking each other into most interesting jellies. Then the foreign
      sailors are handy with their knives. Altogether, a man learns a good deal
      about surgery in Chelsea. But, I say," Barton went on, lowering his voice,
      "where on earth did you pick up&mdash;&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he glanced significantly at a tall man, standing at some distance,
      the centre of half a dozen very youthful revellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cranley, do you mean? I met him at the <i>Trumpet</i> office. He was
      writing about the Coolie Labor Question and the Eastern Question. He has
      been in the South Seas, like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; he has been in a lot of queerer places than the South Seas,"
      answered the other, "and he ought to know something about Coolies. He has
      dealt in them, I fancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay," Maitland replied rather wearily. "He seems to have travelled
      a good deal: perhaps he has travelled in Coolies, whatever they may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my dear fellow, do you know what kind of man your guest is, or don't
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He seems to be a military and sporting kind of gent, so to speak," said
      Maitland; "but what does it matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you don't know why he left his private tutor's; you don't know why
      he left the University; you don't know why he left the Ninety-second; you
      don't know, and no one does, what he did after that; and you never heard
      of that affair with the Frenchman in Egypt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," Maitland replied, "about his ancient history I own I don't know
      anything. As to the row with the Frenchman at Cairo, he told me himself.
      He said the beggar was too small for him to lick, and that duelling was
      ridiculous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They didn't take that view of it at Shephard's Hotel"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is not my affair," said Maitland. "One should see all sort of
      characters, Bielby says. This is not an ordinary fellow. Why, he has been
      a sailor before the mast, he says, by way of adventure, and he is full of
      good stories. I rather like him, and he can't do my moral character any
      harm. <i>I'm</i> not likely to deal in Coolies, at my time of life, nor
      quarrel with warlike aliens."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but he's not a good man to introduce to these boys from Oxford,"
      Barton was saying, when the subject of their conversation came up,
      surrounded by his little court of undergraduates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Thomas Cranley was a good deal older than the company in which he
      found himself. Without being one of the hoary youths who play Falstaff to
      every fresh heir's Prince Harry, he was a middle-aged man, too obviously
      accustomed to the society of boys. His very dress spoke of a prolonged
      youth. À large cat's-eye, circled with diamonds, blazed solitary in his
      shirt-front, and his coat was cut after the manner of the contemporary
      reveller. His chin was clean shaven, and his face, though a good deal
      worn, was ripe, smooth, shining with good cheer, and of a purply bronze
      hue, from exposure to hot suns and familiarity with the beverages of many
      peoples. His full red lips, with their humorous corners, were shaded by a
      small black mustache, and his twinkling bistre-colored eyes, beneath
      mobile black eyebrows, gave Cranley the air of a jester and a good fellow.
      In manner he was familiar, with a kind of deference, too, and reserve,
      "like a dog that is always wagging his tail and deprecating a kick,"
      thought Barton grimly, as he watched the other's genial advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's going to say good-night, bless him," thought Maitland gratefully.
      "Now the others will be moving too, I hope!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So Maitland rose with much alacrity as Cranley approached him. To stand up
      would show, he thought, that he was not inhospitably eager to detain the
      parting guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, Mr. Maitland," said the senior, holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is still early," said the host, doing his best to play his part. "Must
      you really go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; the night's young" (it was about half-past twelve), "but I have a
      kind of engagement to look in at the Cockpit, and three or four of your
      young friends here are anxious to come with me, and see how we keep it up
      round there. Perhaps you and your friend will walk with us." Here he bowed
      slightly in the direction of Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be a little <i>bac</i> going on," he continued&mdash;"<i>un
      petit bac de santé</i>; and these boys tell me they have never played
      anything more elevating than loo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I am no good at a round game," answered Maitland, who had
      played at his Aunt's at Christmas, and who now observed with delight that
      everyone was moving; "but here is Barton, who will be happy to accompany
      you, I daresay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you're for a frolic, boys," said Barton, quoting Dr. Johnson, and
      looking rather at the younger men than at Cranley, "why, I will not balk
      you. Good-night, Maitland."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he shook hands with his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-nights" were uttered in every direction; sticks, hats, and umbrellas
      were hunted up; and while Maitland, half-asleep, was being whirled to his
      rooms in Bloomsbury in a hansom, his guests made the frozen pavement of
      Piccadilly ring beneath their elegant heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is only round the corner," said Cranley to the four or five men who
      accompanied him. "The Cockpit, where I am taking you, is in a fashionable
      slum off St. James's. We're just there."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing either meretricious or sinister in the aspect of that
      favored resort, the Cockpit, as the Decade Club was familiarly called by
      its friends&mdash;and enemies. Two young Merton men and the freshman from
      New, who were enjoying their Christmas vacation in town, and had been
      dining with Maitland, were a little disappointed in the appearance of the
      place. They had hoped to knock mysteriously at a back door in a lane, and
      to be shown, after investigating through a loopholed wicket, into a narrow
      staircase, which, again, should open on halls of light, full of blazing
      wax candles and magnificent lacqueys, while a small mysterious man would
      point out the secret hiding-room, and the passages leading on to the roof
      or into the next house, in case of a raid by the police. Such was the old
      idea of a "Hell;" but the advance of Thought has altered all these early
      notions. The Decade Club was like any other small club. A current of warm
      air, charged with tobacco-smoke, rushed forth into the frosty night when
      the swinging door was opened; a sleepy porter looked out of his little
      nest, and Cranley wrote the names of the companions he introduced in a
      book which was kept for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you are free of the Cockpit for the night," he said, genially. "It's
      a livelier place, in the small hours, than that classical Olympic we've
      just left."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went upstairs, passing the doors of one or two rooms, lit up but
      empty, except for two or three men who were sleeping in uncomfortable
      attitudes on sofas. The whole of the breadth of the first floor, all the
      drawing-room of the house before it became a club, had been turned into a
      card-room, from which brilliant lights, voices, and a heavy odor of
      tobacco and alcohol poured out when the door was opened. A long green
      baize-covered table, of very light wood, ran down the centre of the room,
      while refreshments stood on smaller tables, and a servant out of livery
      sat, half-asleep, behind a great desk in the remotest corner. There were
      several empty chairs round the green baize-covered table, at which some
      twenty men were sitting, with money before them; while one, in the middle,
      dealt out the cards on a broad flap of smooth black leather let into the
      baize. Every now and then he threw the cards he had been dealing into a
      kind of well in the table, and after every deal he raked up his winnings
      with a rake, or distributed gold and counters to the winners, as
      mechanically as if he had been a croupier at Monte Carlo. The players, who
      were all in evening dress, had scarcely looked up when the strangers
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brought some recruits, Cranley?" asked the Banker, adding, as he looked
      at his hand, "<i>J'en donne!</i>" and becoming absorbed in his game again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The game you do not understand?" said Cranley to one of his recruits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite," said the lad, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right; I will soon show you all about it; and I wouldn't play, if I
      were you, till you <i>know</i> all about it. Perhaps, after you know <i>all</i>
      about it, you'll think it wiser not to play at all At least, you might
      well think so abroad, where very fishy things are often done. Here it's
      all right, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is baccarat a game you can be cheated at, then&mdash;I mean, when people
      are inclined to cheat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheat! Oh, rather! There are about a dozen ways of cheating at baccarat."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other young men from Maitland's party gathered round their mentor, who
      continued his instructions in a low voice, and from a distance whence the
      play could be watched, while the players were not likely to be disturbed
      by the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheating is the simplest thing in the world, at Nice or in Paris,"
      Cranley went on; "but to show you how it is done, in case you ever do play
      in foreign parts, I must explain the game. You see the men first put down
      their stakes within the thin white line on the edge of the tabla Then the
      Banker deals two cards to one of the men on his left, and all the fellows
      on that side stand by <i>his</i> luck. Then he deals two to a chappie on
      his right, and all the punters on the right, back that sportsman. And he
      deals two cards to himself. The game is to get as near nine as possible,
      ten, and court cards, not counting at all. If the Banker has eight or
      nine, he does not offer cards; if he has less, he gives the two players,
      if they ask for them, one card each, and takes one himself if he chooses.
      If they hold six, seven, or eight, they stand; if less, they take a card.
      Sometimes one stands at five; it depends. Then the Banker wins if he is
      nearer nine than the players, and they win if <i>they</i> are better than
      he; and that's the whole affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see where the cheating can come in," said one of the young
      fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dozens of ways, as I told you. A man may have an understanding with the
      waiter, and play with arranged packs; but the waiter is always the
      dangerous element in <i>that</i> little combination. He's sure to peach or
      blackmail his accomplice. Then the cards may be marked. I remember, at
      Ostend, one fellow, a big German; he wore spectacles, like all Germans,
      and he seldom gave the players anything better than three court cards when
      he dealt One evening he was in awful luck, when he happened to go for his
      cigar-case, which he had left in the hall in his great-coat pocket. He
      laid down his spectacles on the table, and someone tried them on. As soon
      as he took up the cards he gave a start, and sang out, 'Here's a swindle!
      <i>Nous sommes volés!</i>' He could see, by the help of the spectacles,
      that all the nines and court cards were marked; and the spectacles were
      regular patent double million magnifiers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what became of the owner of the glasses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he just looked into the room, saw the man wearing them, and didn't
      wait to say good-night. He just <i>went!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Cranley chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember another time, at Nice: I always laugh when I think of it!
      There was a little Frenchman who played nearly every night. He would take
      the bank for three or four turns, and he almost always won. Well, one
      night he had been at the theatre, and he left before the end of the piece
      and looked in at the Cercle. He took the Bank: lost once, won twice; then
      he offered cards. The man who was playing nodded, to show he would take
      one, and the Frenchman laid down an eight of clubs, a greasy, dirty old
      rag, with <i>théâtre français de nice</i> stamped on it in big letters. It
      was his ticket of readmission at the theatre that they gave him when he
      went out, and it had got mixed up with a nice little arrangement in cards
      he had managed to smuggle into the club pack. I'll never forget his face
      and the other man's when <i>Théâtre Français</i> turned up. However, you
      understand the game now, and if you want to play, we had better give fine
      gold to the waiter in exchange for bone counters, and get to work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three of the visitors followed Cranley to the corner where the
      white, dissipated-looking waiter of the card-room sat, and provided
      themselves with black and red <i>jetons</i> (bone counters) of various
      values, to be redeemed at the end of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they returned to the table the banker was just leaving his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm cleaned out," said he, "<i>décavé</i>. Good-night," and he walked
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one seemed anxious to open a bank. The punters had been winning all
      night, and did not like to desert their luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, this will never do," cried Cranley. "If no one else will open a bank,
      I'll risk a couple of hundred, just to show you beginners how it is done!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cranley sat down, lit a cigarette, and laid the smooth silver
      cigarette-case before him. Then he began to deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune at first was all on the side of the players. Again and again
      Cranley chucked out the counters he had lost, which the others gathered
      in, or pushed three or four bank-notes with his little rake in the
      direction of a more venturesome winner. The new-comers, who were winning,
      thought they had never taken part in a sport more gentlemanly and amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must have one shy," said Martin, one of the boys who had hitherto stood
      with Barton, behind the Banker, looking on. He was a gaudy youth with a
      diamond stud, rich, and not fond of losing. He staked five pounds and won;
      he left the whole sum on and lost, lost again, a third time, and then
      said, "May I draw a cheque?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you may," Cranley answered. "The waiter will give you <i>tout
      ce qu'il faut pour écrire</i>, as the stage directions say; but I don't
      advise you to plunge. You've lost quite enough. Yet they say the devil
      favors beginners, so you can't come to grief."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow by this time was too excited to take advice. His cheeks
      had an angry flush, his hands trembled as he hastily constructed some
      paper currency of considerable value. The parallel horizontal wrinkles of
      the gambler were just sketched on his smooth girlish brow as he returned
      with his paper. The bank had been losing, but not largely. The luck turned
      again as soon as Martin threw down some of his scrip. Thrice consecutively
      he lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me," said Barton suddenly to Cranley, "may I help myself to one of
      your cigarettes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped as he spoke, over the table, and Cranley saw him pick up the
      silver cigarette-case. It was a handsome piece of polished silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; help yourself. Give me back my cigarette-case, please, when
      you have done with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He dealt again, and lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a nice case!" said Barton, examining it closely. "There is an Arabic
      word engraved on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," said Cranley, rather impatiently, holding out his hand for the
      thing, and pausing before he dealt. "The case was given me by the late
      Khédive, dear old Ismail, bless him! The word is a talisman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so. The case seemed to bring you luck," said Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cranley half turned and threw a quick look at him, as rapid and timid as
      the glance of a hare in its form.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, give me it back, please," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, just oblige me: let me try what there is in luck. Go on playing
      while I rub up my Arabic, and try to read this ineffable name on the case.
      Is it the word of Power of Solomon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cranley glanced back again. "All right," he said, "as you are so curious&mdash;-j'en
      donne!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered cards, and lost. Martin's face brightened up. His paper
      currency was coming back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a shame," grumbled Cranley, "to rob a fellow of his fetich. Waiter,
      a small brandy-and-soda! Confound your awkwardness! Why do you spill it
      over the cards?"
    </p>
    <p>
      By Cranley's own awkwardness, more than the waiter's, a little splash of
      the liquid had fallen in front of him, on the black leather part of the
      table where he dealt. He went on dealing, and his luck altered again. The
      rake was stretched out over both halves of the long table; the gold and
      notes and counters, with a fluttering assortment of Martin's I O U's, were
      all dragged in. Martin went to the den of the money-changer sullenly, and
      came back with fresh supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Banco?" he cried, meaning that he challenged Cranley for all the money in
      the bank. There must have been some seven hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Cranley, taking a sip of his soda water. He had dealt
      two cards, when his hands were suddenly grasped as in two vices, and
      cramped to the table. Barton had bent over from behind and caught him by
      the wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cranley made one weak automatic movement to extricate himself; then he sat
      perfectly still. His face, which he turned over his shoulder, was white
      beneath the stains of tan, and his lips were blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn you!" he snarled. "What trick are you after now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you drunk, Barton?" cried some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave him alone!" shouted some of the players, rising from their seats;
      while others, pressing round Barton, looked over his shoulder without
      seeing any excuse for his behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen," said Barton, in a steady voice, "I leave my conduct in the
      hands of the club. If I do not convince them that Mr. Cranley has been
      cheating, I am quite at their disposal, and at his. Let anyone who doubts
      what I say look here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm looking here, and I don't see what you are making such a fuss
      about," said Martin, from the group behind, peering over at the table and
      the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you kindly&mdash;&mdash; No, it is no use." The last remark was
      addressed to the captive, who had tried to release his hands. "Will you
      kindly take up some of the cards and deal them slowly, to right and left,
      over that little puddle of spilt soda water on the leather? Get as near
      the table as you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead silence while Martin made this experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By gad, I can see every pip on the cards!" cried Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you can; and if you had the art of correcting fortune, you
      could make use of what you see. At the least you would know whether to
      take a card or stand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't," said the wretched Cranley. "How on earth was I to know that
      the infernal fool of a waiter would spill the liquor there, and give you a
      chance against me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You spilt the liquor yourself," Barton answered coolly, "when I took away
      your cigarette-case. I saw you passing the cards over the surface of it,
      which anyone can see for himself is a perfect mirror. I tried to warn you&mdash;for
      I did not want a row&mdash;when I said the case 'seemed to bring you
      luck.' But you would not be warned; and when the cigarette-case trick was
      played out, you fell back on the old dodge with the drop of water. Will
      anyone else convince himself that I am right before I let Mr. Cranley go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      One or two men passed the cards, as they had seen the Banker do, over the
      spilt soda water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a clear case," they said. "Leave him alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton slackened his grip of Cranley's hands, and for some seconds they
      lay as if paralyzed on the table before him, white and cold, with livid
      circles round the wrists. The man's face was deadly pale, and wet with
      perspiration. He put out a trembling hand to the glass of brandy-and-water
      that stood beside him; the class rattled against his teeth as he drained
      all the contents at a gulp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall hear from me," he grumbled, and, with an inarticulate muttering
      of threats he made his way, stumbling and catching at chairs, to the door.
      When he had got outside, he leaned against the wall, like a drunken man,
      and then shambled across the landing into a reading-room. It was empty,
      and Cranley fell into a large easy-chair, where he lay crumpled up, rather
      than sat, for perhaps ten minutes, holding his hand against his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They talk about having the courage of one's opinions. Confound it! Why
      haven't I the nerve for my character? Hang this heart of mine! Will it
      never stop thumping?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up and looked about him, then rose and walked toward the table; but
      his head began to swim, and his eyes to darken; so he fell back again in
      his seat, feeling drowsy and beaten. Mechanically he began to move the
      hand that hung over the arm of his low chair, and it encountered a
      newspaper which had fallen on the floor. He lifted it automatically and
      without thought: it was the <i>Times</i>. Perhaps to try his eyes, and see
      if they served him again after his collapse, he ran them down the columns
      of the advertisements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly something caught his attention; his whole lax figure grew braced
      again as he read a passage steadily through more than twice or thrice.
      When he had quite mastered this, he threw down the paper and gave a low
      whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So the old boy's dead," he reflected; "and that drunken tattooed ass and
      his daughter are to come in for the money and the mines! They'll be clever
      that find him, and I shan't give them his address! What luck some men
      have!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he fell into deep thought, his brows and lips working eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll do it," he said at last, cutting the advertisement out of the paper
      with a penknife. "It isn't often a man has a chance to <i>star</i> in this
      game of existence. I've lost all my own social Lives: one in that business
      at Oxford, one in the row at Ali Musjid, and the third went&mdash;to-night.
      But I'll <i>star</i>. Every sinner should desire a new Life," he added
      with a sneer.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * "Starring" is paying for a new "Life" at Pool.
</pre>
    <p>
      He rose, steady enough now, walked to the door, paused and listened, heard
      the excited voices in the card-room still discussing him, slunk
      down-stairs, took his hat and greatcoat, and swaggered past the porter.
      Mechanically he felt in his pocket, as he went out of the porch, for his
      cigarette-case; and he paused at the little fount of fire at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking that he would never light a cigarette there again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he remembered, and swore. He had left his case on the table of
      the card-room, where Barton had laid it down, and he had not the impudence
      to send back for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Vile damnum!</i>" he muttered (for he had enjoyed a classical
      education), and so disappeared in the frosty night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;In the Snow.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The foul and foggy night of early February was descending, some weeks
      after the scene in the Cockpit, on the river and the town. Night was
      falling from the heavens; or rather, night seemed to be rising from the
      earth&mdash;steamed up, black, from the dingy trampled snow of the
      streets, and from the vapors that swam above the squalid houses. There was
      coal-smoke and a taste of lucifer matches in the air. In the previous
      night there had been such a storm as London seldom sees; the powdery,
      flying snow had been blown for many hours before a tyrannous northeast
      gale, and had settled down, like dust in a neglected chamber, over every
      surface of the city. Drifts and "snow-wreathes," as northern folk say,
      were lying in exposed places, in squares and streets, as deep as they lie
      when sheep are "smoored" on the sides of Sundhope or Penchrist in the
      desolate Border-land. All day London had been struggling under her cold
      winding-sheet, like a feeble, feverish patient trying to throw off a heavy
      white counterpane. Now the counterpane was dirty enough. The pavements
      were three inches deep in a rich greasy deposit of mud and molten ice.
      Above the round glass or iron coverings of coal-cellars the
      foot-passengers slipped, "ricked" their backs, and swore as they stumbled,
      if they did not actually fall down, in the filth. Those who were in haste,
      and could afford it, travelled, at fancy prices, in hansoms with two
      horses driven tandem. The snow still lay comparatively white on the
      surface of the less-frequented thoroughfares, with straight shining black
      marks where wheels had cut their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At intervals in the day the fog had fallen blacker than night. Down by the
      waterside the roads were deep in a mixture of a weak gray-brown or coffee
      color. Beside one of the bridges in Chelsea, an open slope leads straight
      to the stream, and here, in the afternoon&mdash;for a late start was made&mdash;the
      carts of the Vestry had been led, and loads of slush that had choked up
      the streets in the more fashionable parts of the town had been unladen
      into the river. This may not be the most; scientific of sanitary modes of
      clearing the streets and squares, but it was the way that recommended
      itself to the wisdom of the Contractor. In the early evening the fog had
      lightened a little, but it fell sadly again, and grew so thick that the
      bridge was lost in mist half-way across the river, like the arches of that
      fatal bridge beheld by Mirza in his Vision. The masts of the vessels
      moored on the near bank disappeared from view, and only a red lamp or two
      shone against the blackness of the hulks. From the public-house at the
      corner&mdash;the <i>Hit or Miss</i>&mdash;streamed a fan-shaped flood of
      light, soon choked by the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the muddy twilight of a street that runs at right angles to the
      river, a cart came crawling; its high-piled white load of snow was faintly
      visible before the brown horses (they were yoked tandem) came into view.
      This cart was driven down to the water-edge, and was there upturned, with
      much shouting and cracking of whips on the part of the men engaged, and
      with a good deal of straining, slipping, and stumbling on the side of the
      horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men jumped down, and fumbled at the iron pins which kept the
      backboard of the cart in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blarmme, Bill," he grumbled, "if the blessed pins ain't froze."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he put his wet fingers in his mouth, blowing on them afterward, and
      smacking his arms across his breast to restore the circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comrade addressed as Bill merely stared speechlessly as he stood at
      the smoking head of the leader, and the other man tugged again at the pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't budge," he cried at last. "Just run into the <i>Hit or Miss</i>
      at the corner, mate, and borrow a hammer; and you might get a pint o' hot
      beer when ye're at it. Here's fourpence. I was with three that found a
      quid in the <i>Mac</i>,* end of last week; here's the last of it."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A quid in the <i>Mac</i>&mdash;a sovereign in the street-scrapings.
     called <i>Mac</i> from Macadam, and employed as mortar in
     building eligible freehold tenements.
</pre>
    <p>
      He fumbled in his pocket, but his hands were so numb that he could
      scarcely capture the nimble fourpence. Why should the "nimble fourpence"
      have the monopoly of agility?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm Blue Ribbon, Tommy, don't yer know," said Bill, with regretful
      sullenness. His ragged great-coat, indeed, was decorated with the azure
      badge of avowed and total abstinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blow yer blue ribbon! Hold on where ye are, and I'll bring the bloomin'
      hammer myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus growling, Tommy strode indifferent through the snow, his legs
      protected by bandages of straw ropes. Presently he reappeared in the
      warmer yellow of the light that poured through the windows of the old
      public-house. He was wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, which he
      then thrust into the deeps of his pockets, hugging a hammer to his body
      under his armpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little hot beer would do yer bloomin' temper a deal more good than ten
      yards o' blue ribbon at sixpence. Blue ruin's more in <i>my</i> line,"
      observed Thomas, epigram-matically, much comforted by his refreshment. Aid
      with two well-directed taps he knocked the pins out of their sockets, and
      let down the backboard of the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill, uncomforted by ale, sulkily jerked the horses forward; the cart was
      tilted up, and the snow tumbled out, partly into the shallow shore-water,
      partly on to the edge of the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ullo!" cried Tommy suddenly. "E're's an old coat-sleeve a sticking out o'
      the snow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Alves!" exclaimed Bill, with a noble eye on the main chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Alves! of course, 'alves. Ain't we on the same lay," replied the
      chivalrous Tommy. Then he cried, "Lord preserve us, mate; <i>there's a
      cove in the coat!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran forward, and clutched the elbow of the sleeve which stood up
      stiffly above the frozen mound of lumpy snow. He might well have thought
      at first that the sleeve was empty, such a very stick of bone and skin was
      the arm he grasped within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, Bill, help us to dig him out, poor chap!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he dead?" asked Bill, leaving the horses' heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead! he's bound to be dead, under all that weight. But how the dickens
      did he get into the cart? Guess we didn't shovel him in, eh; we'd have
      seen him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the two men had dragged a meagre corpse out of the snow heap.
      A rough worn old pilot-coat, a shabby pair of corduroy trousers, and two
      broken boots through which the toes could be seen peeping ruefully, were
      all the visible raiment of the body. The clothes lay in heavy swathes and
      folds over the miserable bag of bones that had once been a tall man. The
      peaked blue face was half hidden by a fell of iron-gray hair, and a
      grizzled beard hung over the breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men stood for some moments staring at the corpse. A wretched woman
      in a thin gray cotton dress had come down from the bridge, and shivered
      beside the body for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a goner," was her criticism. "I wish <i>I</i> was."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this aspiration she shivered back into the fog again, walking on her
      unknown way. By this time a dozen people had started up from nowhere, and
      were standing in a tight ring round the body. The behavior of the people
      was typical of London gazers. No one made any remark, or offered any
      suggestion; they simply stared with all their eyes and souls, absorbed in
      the unbought excitement of the spectacle. They were helpless, idealess,
      interested and unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run and fetch a peeler, Bill," said Tommy at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peeler be hanged! Bloomin' likely I am to find a peeler. Fetch him
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sulky devil you are," answered Tommy, who was certainly of milder mood;
      whereas Bill seemed a most unalluring example of the virtue of Temperance.
      It is true that he had only been "Blue Ribbon" since the end of his
      Christmas bout&mdash;that is, for nearly a fortnight&mdash;and Virtue, a
      precarious tenant, was not yet comfortable in her new lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Tommy returned from his quest the dusk had deepened into night The
      crowd round the body in the pea-coat had grown denser, and it might truly
      be said that "the more part knew not wherefore they had come together."
      The centre of interest was not a fight, they were sure, otherwise the ring
      would have been swaying this way and that. Neither was it a dispute
      between a cabman and his fare: there was no sound of angry repartees. It
      might be a drunken woman, or a man in a fit, or a lost child. So the outer
      circle of spectators, who saw nothing, waited, and patiently endured till
      the moment of revelation should arrive. Respectable people who passed only
      glanced at the gathering; respectable people may wonder, but they never do
      find out the mystery within a London crowd. On the extreme fringe of the
      mob were some amateurs who had just been drinking in the <i>Hit or Miss</i>.
      They were noisy, curious, and impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Tommy arrived with two policeman, who, acting on his warning, had
      brought with them a stretcher. He had told them briefly how the dead man
      was found in the cart-load of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the men in blue, the crowd of necessity opened. One of the officers
      stooped down and flashed his lantern on the heap of snow where the dead
      face lay, as pale as its frozen pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord, it's old Dicky Shields!" cried a voice in the crowd, as the peaked
      still features were lighted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who spoke was one of the latest spectators that had arrived, after
      the news that some pleasant entertainment was on foot had passed into the
      warm alcoholic air and within the swinging doors of the <i>Hit or Miss</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know him, do you?" asked the policeman with the lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Know him, rather! Didn't I give him sixpence for rum when he tattooed
      this here cross and anchor on my arm? Dicky was a grand hand at tattooing,
      bless you: he'd tattooed himself all over!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker rolled up his sleeve, and showed, on his burly red forearm,
      the emblems of Faith and Hope rather neatly executed in blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, he was in the <i>Hit or Miss</i>," the speaker went on, "no later
      nor last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wot beats me," said Tommy again, as the policeman lifted the light
      corpse, and tried vainly to straighten the frozen limbs, "Wot beats me is
      how he got in this here cart of ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's light enough surely," added Tommy; "but I warrant <i>we</i> didn't
      chuck him on the cart with the snow in Belgrave Square."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you put up at night?" asked one of the policemen suddenly. He
      had been ruminating on the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the yard there, behind that there hoarding," answered Tommy, pointing
      to a breached and battered palisade near the corner of the public-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the back of this ricketty plank fence, with its particolored tatters of
      damp and torn advertisements, lay a considerable space of waste ground.
      The old houses that recently occupied the site had been pulled down,
      probably as condemned "slums," in some moment of reform, when people had
      nothing better to think of than the housing of the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been an idea of building model lodgings for tramps, with all the
      latest improvements, on the space, but the idea evaporated when something
      else occurred to divert the general interest. Now certain sheds, with
      roofs sloped against the nearest walls, formed a kind of lumber-room for
      the parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time the scavengers' carts were housed in the sheds, or outside
      the sheds when these were overcrowded. Not far off were stables for the
      horses, and thus the waste ground was not left wholly unoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was this cart o' yours under the sheds all night or in the open?" asked
      the policeman, with an air of penetration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just outside the shed, worn't it, Bill?" replied Tommy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill said nothing, being a person disinclined to commit himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the cart was outside," said the policeman, "then the thing's plain
      enough. You started from there, didn't you, with the cart in the
      afternoon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," answered Tommy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there was a little sprinkle o' snow in the cart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May be there wos. I don't remember one way or the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you <i>must</i> be a stupid if you don't see that this here cove,"
      pointing to the dead man, "got drinking too much last night, lost hisself,
      and wandered inside the hoarding, where he fell asleep in the cart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Snow do make a fellow bloomin' sleepy," one of the crowd assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he never wakened no more, and the snow had covered over his body
      when you started with the cart, and him in it, unbeknown. He's light
      enough to make no difference to the weight. Was it dark when you started?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of them spells of fog was on; you could hardly see your hand,"
      grunted Tommy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, it's as plain as&mdash;as the nose on your face," said the
      policeman, without any sarcastic intentions. "That's how it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bravo, Bobby!" cried one of the crowd. "They should make you an
      inspector, and set you to run in them dynamiting Irish coves."
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman was not displeased at this popular tribute to his
      shrewdness. Dignity forbade him, however, to acknowledge the compliment,
      and he contented himself with lifting the two handles of the stretcher
      which was next him. A covering was thrown over the face of the dead man,
      and the two policemen, with their burden, began to make their way
      northward to the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small mob followed them, but soon dwindled into a tail of street boys
      and girls. These accompanied the body till it disappeared from their eyes
      within the hospital doors. Then they waited for half an hour or so, and at
      last seemed to evaporate into the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Tommy and his mate had unharnessed their horses and taken
      them to stable, the cart was housed (beneath the sheds this time), and
      Bill had so far succumbed to the genial influences of the occasion as to
      tear off his blue badge and follow Tommy into the <i>Hit or Miss</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few chance acquaintances, hospitable and curious, accompanied them,
      intent on providing with refreshments and plying with questions the heroes
      of so remarkable an adventure. It is true that they already knew all Tommy
      and Bill had to tell; but there is a pleasure, in moments of emotional
      agitation, in repeating at intervals the same questions, and making over
      and again the same profound remarks. The charm of these performances was
      sure to be particularly keen within the very walls where the dead man had
      probably taken his last convivial glass, and where some light was certain
      to be thrown, by the landlady or her customers, on the habits and history
      of poor Dicky Shields.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;An Academic Pothouse.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <i>Hit or Miss</i> tavern, to customers (rough customers, at least)
      who entered it on a foggy winter night, seemed merely a public by the
      river's brim. Not being ravaged and parched by a thirst for the
      picturesque, Tommy and his mates failed to pause and observe the
      architectural peculiarities of the building. Even if they had been of a
      romantic and antiquarian turn, the fog was so thick that they could have
      seen little to admire, though there was plenty to be admired. The <i>Hit
      or Miss</i> was not more antique in its aspect than modern in its
      fortunes. Few public-houses, if any, boasted for their landlord such a
      person as Robert Maitland, M.A., Fellow of St. Gatien's, in the University
      of Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, perhaps, desirable and even necessary to explain how this
      arrangement came into existence. We have already made acquaintance with
      "mine host" of the <i>Hit or Miss</i>, and found him to be by no means the
      rosy, genial Boniface of popular tradition. That a man like Maitland
      should be the lessee of a waterside tavern, like the <i>Hit or Miss</i>,
      was only one of the anomalies of this odd age of ours. An age of revivals,
      restorations, experiments&mdash;an age of dukes who are Socialists&mdash;an
      age which sees the East-end brawling in Pall Mall, and parties of West-end
      tourists personally conducted down Ratcliffe Highway&mdash;need not wonder
      at Maitland's eccentric choice in philanthropy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland was an orphan, and rich. He had been an unpopular lonely boy at a
      public school, where he was known as a "sap," or assiduous student, and
      was remarked for an almost unnatural indifference to cricket and rowing.
      At Oxford, as he had plenty of money, he had been rather less unpopular.
      His studies ultimately won him a Fellowship at St. Gatien's, where his
      services as a tutor were not needed. Maitland now developed a great desire
      to improve his own culture by acquaintance with humanity, and to improve
      humanity by acquaintance with himself. This view of life and duty had been
      urged on him by his college "coach," philosopher, and friend, Mr. Joseph
      Bielby. A man of some energy of character, Bielby had made Maitland leave
      his desultory reading and dull hospitalities at St. Gatien's and betake
      himself to practical philanthropy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You tell me you don't see much in life," Bielby had said. "Throw yourself
      into the life of others, who have not much to live on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland made a few practical experiments in philanthropy at Oxford. He
      once subsidized a number of glaziers out on strike, and thereon had his
      own windows broken by conservative undergraduates. He urged on the
      citizens the desirability of running a steam tramway for the people from
      the station to Cowley, through Worcester, John's, Baliol, and Wadham
      Gardens and Magdalene. His signature headed a petition in favor of having
      three "devils," or steam-whoopers, yelling in different quarters of the
      town between five and six o'clock every morning, that the artisans might
      be awakened in time for the labors of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Maitland's schemes made more noise than progress at Oxford, Bielby
      urged him to come out of his Alma Mater and practise benevolence in town.
      He had a great scheme for building over Hyde Park, and creating a Palace
      of Art in Poplar with the rents of the new streets. While pushing this
      ingenious idea in the columns of the <i>Daily Trumpet</i>, Maitland looked
      out for some humbler field of personal usefulness. The happy notion of
      taking a philanthropic public-house occurred to him, and was acted upon at
      the first opportunity. Maitland calculated that in his own bar-room he
      could acquire an intimate knowledge of humanity in its least sophisticated
      aspects. He would sell good beer, instead of drugged and adulterated stuff
      He would raise the tone of his customers, while he would insensibly gain
      some of their exuberant vitality. He would shake off the prig (which he
      knew to be a strong element in his nature), and would, at the same time,
      encourage temperance by providing good malt liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scheme seemed feasible, and the next thing to do was to acquire a
      tavern. Now, Maitland had been in the Oxford movement just when
      æstheticism was fading out, like a lovely sun-stricken lily, while
      philanthropy and political economy and Mr. Henry George were coming in,
      like roaring lions. Thus in Maitland there survived a little of the old
      leaven of the student of Renaissance, a touch of the amateur of
      "impressions" and of antiquated furniture. He was always struggling
      against this "side," as he called it, of his "culture," and in his hours
      of reaction he was all for steam tramways, "devils," and Kindergartens
      standing where they ought not. But there were moments when his old
      innocent craving for the picturesque got the upper hand; and in one of
      those moments Maitland had come across the chance of acquiring the lease
      of the <i>Hit or Miss</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      That ancient bridge-house pleased him, and he closed with his opportunity.
      The <i>Hit or Miss</i> was as attractive to an artistic as most
      public-houses are to a thirsty soul When the Embankment was made, the
      bridge-house had been one of a street of similar quaint and many-gabled
      old buildings that leaned up against each other for mutual support near
      the rivers edge. But the Embankment slowly brought civilization that way:
      the dirty rickety old houses were both condemned and demolished, till at
      last only the tavern remained, with hoardings and empty spaces, and a
      dust-yard round it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
The house stood at what had been a corner. The red-tiled roof was so
high-pitched as to be almost perpendicular. The dormer windows of the
attics were as picturesque as anything in Nuremberg. The side-walls
were broken in their surface by little odd red-tiled roofs covering
projecting casements, and the house was shored up and supported by huge
wooden beams. You entered (supposing you to enter a public-house) by a
low-browed door in front, if you passed in as ordinary customers did. At
one corner was an odd little board, with the old-fashioned sign:

     "Jack's Bridge House.
     "<i>Hit or Miss</i>&mdash;Luck's All."
</pre>
    <p>
      But there was a side-door, reached by walking down a covered way, over
      which the strong oaken rafters (revealed by the unflaking of the plaster)
      lay bent and warped by years and the weight of the building. From this
      door you saw the side, or rather the back, which the house kept for its
      intimates; a side even more picturesque with red-tiled roofs and dormer
      windows than that which faced the street. The passage led down to a slum,
      and on the left hand, as you entered, lay the empty space and the
      dust-yard where the carts were sheltered in sheds, or left beneath the
      sky, behind the ruinous hoarding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within, the <i>Hit or Miss</i> looked cosey enough to persons entering out
      of the cold and dark. There was heat, light, and a bar-parlor with a wide
      old-fashioned chimney-place, provided with seats within the ingle. On
      these little benches did Tommy and his friends make haste to place
      themselves, comfortably disposed, and thawing rapidly, in a room within a
      room, as it were; for the big chimney-place was like a little chamber by
      itself. Not on an ordinary night could such a party have gained admittance
      to the bar-parlor, where Maitland himself was wont to appear, now and
      then, when he visited the tavern, and to produce by his mere presence, and
      without in the least intending it, an Early Closing Movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-night was no common night, and Mrs. Gullick, the widowed landlady,
      or rather manager, was as eager to hear all the story of the finding of
      poor Dicky Shields as any of the crowd outside had been. Again and again
      the narrative was repeated, till conjecture once more began to take the
      place of assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder," asked one of the men, "how old Dicky got the money for a
      boose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The money, ay, and the chance," said another. "That daughter of his&mdash;a
      nice-looking girl she is&mdash;kept poor Dicky pretty tight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't let him get&mdash;" the epigrammatist of the company was just
      beginning to put in, when the brilliant witticism he was about to utter
      burst at once on the intellect of all his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't let him <i>get</i> tight, you was a-goin' to say, Tommy," howled
      three or four at once, and there ensued a great noise of the slapping of
      thighs, followed by chuckles which exploded, at intervals, like crackers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dicky 'ad been 'avin' bad times for long," the first speaker went on. "I
      guess he 'ad about tattooed all the parish as would stand a pint for
      tattooing. There was hardly a square inch of skin not made beautiful
      forever about here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! and there was no sale for his beastesses and bird-ses nuther; or else
      he was clean sold out, and hadn't no capital to renew his stock of hairy
      cats and young parrots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very stuffed beasts, perched above old Dicky's shop, had got to look
      real mangey and mouldy. I think I see them now: the fox in the middle, the
      long-legged moulting foreign bird at one end, and that 'ere shiny old
      rhinoceros in the porch under them picters of the dying deer and t'other
      deer swimming. Poor old Dicky! Where he raised the price o' a drain, let
      alone a booze, beats me, it does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said Mrs. Gullick, who had been in the outer room during the
      conversation, "why, it was a sailor gentleman that stood Dicky treat A
      most pleasant-spoken man for a sailor, with a big black beard He used to
      meet Dicky here, in the private room up-stairs, and there Dicky used to do
      him a turn of his trade&mdash;tattooing him, like. 'I'm doing him to
      pattern, mum,' Dicky sez, sez he: 'a <i>facsimile</i> o' myself, mum.' It
      wasn't much they drank neither&mdash;just a couple of pints; for sez the
      sailor gentleman, he sez, 'I'm afeared, mum, our friend here can't carry
      much even of <i>your</i> capital stuff. We must excuse' sez he, 'the
      failings of an artis'; but I doesn't want his hand to shake or slip when
      he's a doin' <i>me</i>,' sez he. 'Might > spile the pattern,' he sez,
      'also hurt' And I wouldn't have served old Dicky with more than was good
      for him, myself, not if it was ever so, I wouldn't I promised that poor
      daughter of his, before Mr. Maitland sent her to school&mdash;years ago
      now&mdash;I promised as I would keep an eye on her father, and speak of&mdash;A
      hangel, if here isn't Mr. Maitland his very self!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Gullick arose, with bustling courtesy, to welcome her landlord,
      the Fellow of St. Gatien's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately there was a stir among the men seated in the ingle. One by one&mdash;some
      with a muttered pretence at excuse, others with shame-faced awkwardness&mdash;they
      shouldered and shuffled out of the room. Maitland's appearance had
      produced its usual effect, and he was left alone with his tenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mrs. Gullick," said poor Maitland, ruefully, "I came here for a
      chat with our friends&mdash;a little social relaxation&mdash;on economic
      questions, and I seem to have frightened them all away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir, they're a rough lot, and don't think themselves company for the
      likes of you. But," said Mrs. Gullick, eagerly&mdash;with the delight of
      the oldest aunt in telling the saddest tale&mdash;"you 've heard this
      hawful story? Poor Miss Margaret, sir! It makes my blood&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      What physiological effect on the circulation Mrs. Gullick was about to
      ascribe to alarming intelligence will never be known; for Maitland,
      growing a little more pallid than usual, interrupted her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened to Miss Margaret? Tell me, quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing to <i>herself</i>, poor lamb, but her poor father, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland seemed sensibly relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what about her father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone, sir&mdash;gone! In a cartload o' snow, this very evening, he was
      found, just outside o* this very door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a cartload of snow!" cried Maitland. "Do you mean that he went away in
      it, or that he was found in it dead?"

    <p>
      "Yes, indeed, sir; dead for many hours, the doctor said; and in this very
      house he had been no later than last night, and quite steady, sir, I do
      assure you. He had been steady&mdash;oh, steady for weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland assumed an expression of regret, which no doubt he felt to a
      certain extent But in his sorrow there could not but have been some
      relief. For Maitland, in the course of his philanthropic labors, had known
      old Dicky Shields, the naturalist and professional tattooer, as a hopeless
      <i>mauvais sujet</i>. But Dicky's daughter, Margaret, had been a daisy
      flourishing by the grimy waterside, till the young social reformer
      transplanted her to a school in the purer air of Devonshire. He was having
      her educated there, and after she was educated&mdash;why, then, Maitland
      had at one time entertained his own projects or dreams. In the way of
      their accomplishment Dicky Shields had been felt as an obstacle; not that
      he objected&mdash;on the other hand, he had made Maitland put his views in
      writing. There were times&mdash;there had lately, above all, been times&mdash;when
      Maitland reflected uneasily on the conditional promises in this document
      Dicky was not an eligible father-in-law, however good and pretty a girl
      his daughter might be. But now Dicky had ceased to be an obstacle; he was
      no longer (as he certainly had been) in any man's way; he was nobody's
      enemy now, not even his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vision of all these circumstances passed rapidly, like a sensation
      rather than a set of coherent thoughts, through Maitland's consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me everything you know of this wretched business," he said, rising
      and closing the door which led into the outer room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, you have not been here for some weeks, or you would know that
      Dicky had found a friend lately&mdash;an old shipmate, or petty-officer,
      he called him&mdash;a sailor-man. Well-to-do, he seemed; the mate of a
      merchant vessel he might be. He had known Dicky, I think, long ago at sea,
      and he'd bring him here 'to yarn with him,' he said, once or twice it
      might be in this room, but mainly in the parlor up-stairs. He let old
      Dicky tattoo him a bit, up there, to put him in the way of earning an
      honest penny by his trade&mdash;a queer trade it was. Never more than a
      pint, or a glass of hot rum and water, would he give the old man. Most
      considerate and careful, sir, he ever was. Well, last night he brought him
      in about nine, and they sat rather late; and about twelve the sailor comes
      in, rubbing his eyes, and 'Good-night, mum,' sez he. 'My friend's been
      gone for an hour. An early bird he is, and I've been asleep by myself. If
      you please, I'll just settle our little score. It's the last for a long
      time, for I'm bound to-morrow for the China Seas, eastward. Oh, mum, a
      sailor's life!' So he pays, changing a half-sovereign, like a gentleman,
      and out he goes, and that's the last I ever see o' poor Dicky Shields till
      he was brought in this afternoon, out of the snow-cart, cold and stiff,
      sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how do you suppose all this happened? How did Shields get <i>into</i>
      the cart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's just what they've been wondering at, though the cart was
      handy and uncommon convenient for a man as 'ad too much, if 'ad he '<i>ad</i>;
      as believe it I cannot, seeing a glass of hot rum and water would not
      intoxicate a babe. May be he felt faint, and laid down a bit, and never
      wakened. But, Lord a mercy, what's <i>that</i>?" screamed Mrs. Gullick,
      leaping to her feet in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latched door which communicated with the staircase had been burst
      open, and a small brown bear had rushed erect into the room, and, with a
      cry, had thrown itself on Mrs. Gullick's bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if ever I '<i>ad</i> a fright!" that worthy lady exclaimed, turning
      toward the startled Maitland, and embracing at the same time the little
      animal in an affectionate clasp. "Well, if <i>ever</i> there was such a
      child as you, Lizer! What is the matter with you <i>now</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother," cried the bear, "I dreamed of that big Bird I saw on the
      roof, and I ran down-stairs before I was 'arf awake, I was that horful
      frightened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you just go up-stairs again&mdash;and here's a sweet-cake for you&mdash;and
      you take this night-light," said Mrs. Gullick, producing the articles she
      mentioned, "and put it in the basin careful, and knock on the floor with
      the poker if you want me. If it wasn't for that bearskin Mr. Toopny was
      kind enough to let you keep, you'd get your death o' cold, you would,
      running about in the night. And look 'ere, Lizer," she added, patting the
      child affectionately on the shoulder, "do get that there Bird out o' your
      head. It's just nothing but indigestion comes o' you and the other
      children&mdash;himps they may well call you, and himps I'm sure you are&mdash;always
      wasting your screws on pasty and lemonade and raspberry vinegar.
      Just-nothing but indigestion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus admonished, the bear once more threw its arms, in a tight embrace,
      about Mrs. Gullick's neck; and then, without lavishing attention on
      Maitland, passed out of the door, and could be heard skipping up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure, sir, I ask your pardon," exclaimed poor Mrs. Gullick; "but
      Lizer's far from well just now, and she did have a scare last night, or
      else, which is more likely, her little inside (saving your presence) has
      been upset with a supper the Manager gave all them pantermime himps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Mrs. Gullick, why is she dressed like a bear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's such a favorite with the Manager, sir, and the Property Man, and
      all of them at the <i>Hilarity</i>, you can't <i>think</i>, sir," said
      Mrs. Gullick, not in the least meaning to impugn Maitland's general
      capacity for abstract speculation. "A regular little genius that child is,
      though I says it as shouldn't. Ah, sir, she takes it from her poor father,
      sir." And Mrs. Gullick raised her apron to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the late Mr. Gullick had been a clown of considerable merit; but, like
      too many artists, he was addicted beyond measure to convivial enjoyment.
      Maitland had befriended him in his last days, and had appointed Mrs.
      Gullick (and a capital appointment it was) to look after his property when
      he became landlord of the <i>Hit or Miss</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a gift, sir, that child always had! Why, when she was no more than
      four, I well remember her going to fetch the beer, and her being a little
      late, and Gullick with the thirst on him, when she came in with the jug,
      he made a cuff at her, not to hurt her, and if the little thing didn't
      drop the jug, and take the knap! Lord, I thought Gullick would 'a died
      laughing, and him so thirsty, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take the knap?" said Maitland, who imagined that "the knap" must be some
      malady incident to childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir, it's when one person cuffs at another on the stage, you know,
      and the other slaps his own hand, on the far side, to make the noise of a
      box on the ear: that's what we call 'taking the knap' in the profession.
      And the beer was spilt, and the jug broken, and all&mdash;Lizer was that
      clever? And this is her second season, just ended, as a himp at the <i>Hilarity</i>
      pantermime; and they're that good to her, they let her bring her bearskin
      home with her, what she wears, you know, sir, as the Little Bear in 'The
      Three Bears,' don't you know, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland was acquainted with the legend of the Great Bear, the Middle
      Bear, and the Little Tiny Small Bear, and had even proved, in a learned
      paper, that the Three Bears were the Sun, the Moon, and the Multitude of
      Stars in the Aryan myth. But he had not seen the pantomime founded on the
      traditional narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what was the child saying about a big Bird?" he asked. "What was it
      that frightened her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir, I think it was just tiredness, and may be, a little something
      hot at that supper last night; and, besides, seeing so many queer things
      in pantermimes might put notions in a child's head. But when she came home
      last night, a little late, Lizer was very strange. She vowed and swore she
      had seen a large Bird, far bigger than any common bird, skim over the
      street. Then when I had put her to bed in the attic, down she flies,
      screaming she saw the Bird on the roof. I had hard work to get her to
      sleep. To-day I made her lay a-bed and wear her theatre pantermime
      bearskin, that fits her like another skin&mdash;and she'll be too big for
      it next year&mdash;just to keep her warm in that cold garret. That's all
      about it, sir. She'll be well enough in a day or two, will Lizer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure I hope she will, Mrs. Gullick," said Maitland; "and, as I am
      passing his way, I will ask Dr. Barton to call and see the little girl.
      Now I must go, and I think the less we say to anyone about Miss Shields,
      you know, the better. It will be very dreadful for her to learn about her
      father's death, and we must try to prevent Her from hearing how it
      happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sir," said Mrs. Gullick, bobbing; "and being safe away at
      school, sir, we'll hope she won't be told no more than she needn't know
      about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland went forth into the thick night: a half-hearted London thaw was
      filling the shivering air with a damp brown fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the nearest telegraph office, and did not observe, in the raw
      darkness and in the confusion of his thoughts, that he was followed at no
      great distance by a man muffled up in a great-coat and a woollen
      comforter. The stranger almost shouldered against him, as he stood reading
      his telegram, and conscientiously docking off a word here and there to
      save threepence,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "From Robert Maitland to Miss Marlett.
     "The Dovecot, Conisbeare,
     "Tiverton.
     "I come to-morrow, leaving by 10.30 train. Do
     not let Margaret see newspaper. Her father dead.
     Break news."
</pre>
    <p>
      This telegram gave Maitland, in his excited state, more trouble to
      construct than might have been expected. We all know the wondrous badness
      of post-office pens or pencils, and how they tear or blot the paper when
      we are in a hurry; and Maitland felt hurried, though there was no need for
      haste. Meantime the man in the woollen comforter was buying stamps, and,
      finishing his bargain before the despatch was stamped and delivered, went
      out into the fog, and was no more seen.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;Miss Marlett's.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Girls' schools are chilly places. The unfortunate victims, when you chance
      to meet them, mostly look but half-alive, and dismally cold. Their noses
      (however charming these features may become in a year or two, or even may
      be in the holidays) appear somehow of a frosty temperature in the long
      dull months of school-time. The hands, too, of the fair pupils are apt to
      seem larger than common, inclined to blue in color, and, generally, are
      suggestive of inadequate circulation. À tendency to get as near the fire
      as possible (to come within the frontiers of the hearth-rug is forbidden),
      and to cower beneath shawls, is also characteristic of joyous girlhood&mdash;school-girlhood,
      that is. In fact, one thinks of a girls' school as too frequently a spot
      where no one takes any lively exercise (for walking in a funereal
      procession is not exercise, or Mutes might be athletes), and where there
      is apt to be a pervading impression of insufficient food, insufficient
      clothing, and general unsatisfied tedium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Marlett's Establishment for the Highest Education of Girls, more
      briefly known as "The Dovecot, Conisbeare," was no exception, on a
      particularly cold February day&mdash;the day after Dicky Shields was found
      dead&mdash;to these pretty general rules. The Dovecot, before it became a
      girls' school, was, no doubt, a pleasant English home, where "the fires
      wass coot," as the Highlandman said. The red-brick house, with its lawn
      sloping down to the fields, all level with snow, stood at a little
      distance from the main road, at the end of a handsome avenue of Scotch
      pines. But the fires at Miss Marlett's were not good on this February
      morning. They never <i>were</i> good at the Dovecot. Miss Marlett was one
      of those people who, fortunately for themselves, and unfortunately for
      persons dwelling under their roofs, never feel cold, or never know what
      they feel. Therefore, Miss Marlett never poked the fire, which,
      consequently used to grow black toward its early death, and was only
      revived, at dangerously long intervals, by the most minute doses of
      stimulant in the shape of rather damp small coals. Now, supplies of coal
      had run low at the Dovecot, for the very excellent reason that the roads
      were snowed up, and that convoys of the precious fuel were scarcely to be
      urged along the heavy ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      This did not matter much to the equable temperature of Miss Marlett; but
      it did matter a great deal to her shivering pupils, three of whom were
      just speeding their morning toilette, by the light of one candle, at the
      pleasant hour of five minutes to seven on a frosty morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh dear," said one maiden&mdash;Janey Harman by name&mdash;whose blonde
      complexion should have been pink and white, but was mottled with alien and
      unbecoming hues, "<i>why</i> won't that old Cat let us have fires to dress
      by? Gracious, Margaret, how black your fingers are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and I cant get them clean," said Margaret, holding up two very
      pretty dripping hands, and quoting, in mock heroic parody:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Ho, dogs of false Tarentum,
     Are not my <i>hands</i> washed white?"
</pre>
    <p>
      "No talking in the bedrooms, young ladies," came a voice, accompanied by
      an icy draught, from the door, which was opened just enough to admit a
      fleeting vision of Miss Mariettas personal charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was only repeating my lay, Miss Marlett," replied the maiden thus
      rebuked, in a tone of injured innocence&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'Ho, dogs of false Tarentum,'"
</pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;and the door closed again on Miss Marlett, who had not altogether
      the best of it in this affair of outposts, and could not help feeling as
      if "that Miss Shields" was laughing at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Cat!" the young lady went on, in a subdued whisper. "But no wonder my
      hands were a little black, Janey. You forget that it's my week to be
      Stoker. Already, girls, by an early and unexpected movement, I have cut
      off some of the enemy's supplies."
    </p>
    <p>
      So speaking, Miss Margaret Shields proudly displayed a small deposit of
      coals, stored, for secrecy, in the bottom of a clothes-basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious, Daisy, how clever! Well, you are something <i>like</i> a
      stoker," exclaimed the third girl, who by this time had finished dressing:
      "we shall have a blaze to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it must be said that at Miss Marlett's school, by an unusual and
      inconsistent concession to comfort and saniitary principles, the elder
      girls were allowed to have fires in their bed-rooms at night, in winter.
      But seeing that these fires resembled the laughter of the wicked, inasmuch
      as they were brief-lived as the crackling of thorns under pots, the girls
      were driven to make predatory attacks on fuel wherever it could be found.
      Sometimes, one is sorry to say, they robbed each other's fireplaces, and
      concealed the coal in their pockets. But this conduct&mdash;resembling
      what is fabled of the natives of the Scilly Islands, that they "eke out a
      precarious livelihood by taking in each other's washing"&mdash;led to
      strife and bickering; so that the Stoker for the week (as the girl
      appointed to collect these supplies was called) had to infringe a little
      on the secret household stores of Miss Marlett. This week, as it happened,
      Margaret Shields was the Stoker, and she so bore herself in her high
      office as to extort the admiration of the very housemaids.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Even the ranks of Tusculum
     Could scarce forbear to cheer,"
</pre>
    <p>
      if we may again quote the author who was at that time Miss Shields'
      favorite poet. Miss Shields had not studied Mr. Matthew Arnold, and was
      mercifully unaware that not to detect the "pinchbeck" in the <i>Lays</i>
      is the sign of a grovelling nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she was sent to Miss Marlett's, four years ere this date, Margaret
      Shields' instruction had been limited. "The best thing that could be said
      for it," as the old sporting prophet remarked of his own education, "was
      that it had been mainly eleemosynary." The Chelsea School Board fees could
      but rarely be extracted from old Dicky Shields. But Robert Maitland, when
      still young in philanthropy, had seen the clever, merry, brown-eyed child
      at some school treat, or inspection, or other function; had covenanted in
      some sort with her shiftless parent; had rescued the child from the
      streets, and sent her as a pupil to Miss Marlett's. Like Mr. Day, the
      accomplished author of "Sandford and Merton," and creator of the immortal
      Mr. Barlow, Robert Maitland had conceived the hope that he might have a
      girl educated up to his own intellectual standard, and made, or
      "ready-made," a helpmate meet for him. He was, in a more or less formal
      way, the guardian of Margaret Shields, and the ward might be expected (by
      anyone who did not know human nature any better) to blossom into the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland could "please himself," as people say; that is, in his choice of
      a partner he had no relations to please&mdash;no one but the elect young
      lady, who, after all, might not be "pleased" with alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether pleased or not, there could be no doubt that Margaret Shields was
      extremely pleasing. Beside her two shivering chamber-mates
      ("chamber-dekyns" they would have been called, in Oxford slang, four
      hundred years ago), Miss Shields looked quite brilliant, warm, and
      comfortable, even in the eager and the nipping air of Miss Marlett's
      shuddering establishment, and by the frosty light of a single candle. This
      young lady was tall and firmly fashioned; a nut-brown maid, with a ruddy
      glow on her cheeks, with glossy hair rolled up in a big tight knot, and
      with à smile (which knew when it was well off) always faithful to her
      lips. These features, it is superfluous to say in speaking of a heroine,
      "were rather too large for regular beauty." She was perfectly ready to
      face the enemy (in which light she humorously regarded her mistress) when
      the loud cracked bell jangled at seven o'clock exactly, and the drowsy
      girls came trooping from the dormitories down into the wintry class-rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arithmetical diversions, in a cold chamber, were the intellectual treat
      which awaited Margaret and her companions. Arithmetic and slates! Does
      anyone remember&mdash;can anyone forget&mdash;how horribly distasteful a
      slate can be when the icy fingers of youth have to clasp that cold
      educational formation (Silurian, I believe), and to fumble with the greasy
      slate-pencil? With her Colenso in her lap, Margaret Shields grappled for
      some time with the mysteries of Tare and Tret. "Tare an' 'ouns, <i>I</i>
      call it," whispered Janey Harman, who had taken, in the holidays, a
      "course" of Lever's Irish novels. Margaret did not make very satisfactory
      progress with her commercial calculations. After hopelessly befogging
      herself, she turned to that portion of Colenso's engaging work which is
      most palpitating with actuality:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If ten Surrey laborers, in mowing a field of forty acres, drink
      twenty-three quarts of beer, how much cider will thirteen Devonshire
      laborers consume in building a stone wall of thirteen roods four poles in
      length, and four feet six in height?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This problem, also, proved too severe for Margaret's mathematical
      endowments, and (it is extraordinary how childish the very greatest girls
      can be) she was playing at "oughts and crosses" with Janey Harman when the
      arithmetic master came round. He sat down, not unwillingly, beside Miss
      Shields, erased, without comment, the sportive diagrams, and set himself
      vigorously to elucidate (by "the low cunning of algebra") the difficult
      sum from Colenso.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, it is like <i>this</i>," he said, mumbling rapidly, and
      scribbling a series of figures and letters which the pupil was expected to
      follow with intelligent interest. But the rapidity of the processes quite
      dazed Margaret: a result not unusual when the teacher understands his
      topic so well, and so much as a matter of course that he cannot make
      allowance for the benighted darkness of the learner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ninety-five firkins fourteen gallons three quarts. You see, it's quite
      simple," said Mr. Cleghorn, the arithmetic master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you; I <i>see</i>," said Margaret, with the kind readiness of
      woman, who would profess to "see" the Secret of Hegel, or the inmost heart
      of the Binomial Theorem, or the nature of the duties of cover-point, or
      the latest hypothesis about the frieze of the Parthenon, rather than be
      troubled with prolonged explanations, which the expositor, after all,
      might find it inconvenient to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arithmetic and algebra were not this scholar's <i>forte</i>; and no young
      lady in Miss Marlett's establishment was so hungry, or so glad when eight
      o'clock struck and the bell rang for breakfast, as Margaret Shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast at Miss Marlett's was not a convivial meal. There was a long
      narrow table, with cross-tables at each end, these high seats, or <i>dais</i>,
      being occupied by Miss Marlett and the governesses. At intervals down the
      table were stacked huge piles of bread and butter&mdash;of extremely thick
      bread and surprisingly thin butter&mdash;each slice being divided into
      four portions. The rest of the banquet consisted solely of tea. Whether
      this regimen was enough to support growing girls, who had risen at seven,
      till dinnertime at half-past one, is a problem which, perhaps, the
      inexperienced intellect of man can scarcely approach with confidence. But,
      if girls do not always learn as much at school as could be desired,
      intellectually speaking, it is certain that they have every chance of
      acquiring Spartan habits, and of becoming accustomed (if familiarity
      really breeds contempt) to despise hunger and cold. Not that Miss
      Marlett's establishment was a <i>Dothegirls Hall</i>, nor a school much
      more scantily equipped with luxuries than others. But the human race has
      still to learn that girls need good meals just as much as, or more than,
      persons of maturer years. Boys are no better off at many places; but boys
      have opportunities of adding bloaters and chops to their breakfasts, which
      would be considered horribly indelicate and insubordinate conduct in
      girls.

    <p>
      "Est ce que vous aimez les tartines à l'Anglaise," said Janey Harman to
      Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ce que j'aime dans la tartine, c'est la simplicité prime-sautière da sa
      nature," answered Miss Shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the charms of the "matinal meal" (as the author of "Guy
      Livingstone" calls breakfast) that the young ladies were all compelled to
      talk French (and such French!) during this period of refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toutes choses, la cuisine exceptée, sont Françaises, dans cet
      établissement peu recréatif," went on Janey, speaking low and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Je déteste le Français," Margaret answered, "mais je le préfère
      infiniment à l'Allemand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comment accentuez, vous le mot préfère, Marguerite?" asked Miss Marlett,
      who had heard the word, and who neglected no chance of conveying
      instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, two accents&mdash;one this way, and the other that," answered
      Margaret, caught unawares. She certainly did not reply in the most correct
      terminology.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vous allez perdre dix marks," remarked the schoolmistress, if
      incorrectly, perhaps not too severely. But perhaps it is not easy to say,
      off-hand, what word Miss Marlett ought to have employed for "marks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Voici les lettres qui arrivent," whispered Janey to Margaret, as the
      post-bag was brought in and deposited before Miss Marlett, who opened it
      with a key and withdrew the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a trying moment for the young ladies. Miss Marlett first sorted
      out all the letters for the girls, which came, indubitably and
      unmistakably, from fathers and mothers. Then she picked out the other
      letters, those directed to young ladies whom she thought she could trust,
      and handed them over in honorable silence. These maidens were regarded
      with envy by the others. Among them was not Miss Harman, whose letters
      Miss Marlett always deliberately opened and read before delivering them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Il y a une lettre pour moi, et elle va la lire," said poor Janey to her
      friend, who, for her part, never received any letters, save a few, at
      stated intervals, from Maitland. These Miss Shields used to carry about in
      her pocket without opening them till they were all crumply at the edges.
      Then she hastily mastered their contents, and made answer in the briefest
      and most decorous manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Qui est votre correspondent?" Margaret asked. We are not defending her
      French.
    </p>
    <p>
      "C'est le pauvre Harry Wyville," answered Janey. "Il est sous-lieutenant
      dans les Berkshires à Aldershot Pourquoi ne doit il pas écrire à moi, il
      est comme on diroit, mon frère."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Est il votre parent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Non, pas du tout, mais je l'ai connu pour des ans. Oh, pour des ans!
      Voici, elle à deux dépêches télégraphiques," Janey added, observing two
      orange colored envelopes which had come in the mail-bag with the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this moment Miss Marlett finished the fraternal epistle of Lieutenant
      Wyville, which she folded up with a frown and returned to the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jeanne je veux vous parler à part, après, dans mon boudoir," remarked
      Miss Marlett severely; and Miss Herman, becoming a little blanched,
      displayed no further appetite for tartines, nor for French conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, to see another, and a much older lady, read letters written to one
      by a lieutenant at Aldershot, whom one has known for years, and who is
      just like one's brother, is a trial to any girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Miss Marlett betook herself to her own correspondence, which, as
      Janey had noticed, included <i>two</i> telegraphic despatches in
      orange-colored envelopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she had not rushed at these, and opened them first, proves the
      admirable rigidity of her discipline. Any other woman would have done so,
      but it was Miss Marietta rule to dispose of the pupils' correspondence
      before attending to her own. "Business first, pleasure afterward," was the
      motto of this admirable woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast ended, as the girls were leaving the room for the tasks of the
      day, Miss Marlett beckoned Margaret aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to me, dear, in the boudoir, after Janey Harman," said the
      schoolmistress in English, and in a tone to which Margaret was so
      unaccustomed that she felt painfully uneasy and anxious&mdash;unwonted
      moods for this careless maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Janey, something must have happened," she whispered to her friend, who
      was hardening her own heart for the dreadful interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something's <i>going</i> to happen, I'm sure," said poor Janey,
      apprehensively, and then she entered the august presence, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret remained at the further end of the passage, leading to what Miss
      Marlett, when she spoke French, called her "boudoir." The girl felt colder
      than even the weather warranted. She looked alternately at Miss Marietta
      door and out of the window, across the dead blank flats to the low white
      hills far away. Just under the window one of the little girls was
      standing, throwing crumbs, remains of the tartines, to robins and
      sparrows, which chattered and fought over the spoil. One or two
      blackbirds, with their yellow bills, fluttered shyly on the outside of the
      ring of more familiar birds. Up from the south a miserable blue-gray haze
      was drifting and shuddering, ominous of a thaw. From the eaves and the
      branches of the trees heavy drops kept falling, making round black holes
      in the snow, and mixing and melting here and there in a yellowish plash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret shivered. Then she heard the boudoir door open, and Janey came
      out, making a plucky attempt not to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" whispered Margaret, forgetting the dread interview before
      her, and her own unformed misgivings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She won't give me the letter. I'm to have it when I go home for good; and
      I'm to go home for good at the holidays," whimpered Janey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Janey!" said Margaret, petting the blonde head on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Margaret Shields, come here!" cried Miss Marlett, in a shaky voice, from
      the boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to the back music-room when she's done with you," the other girl
      whispered. And Margaret marched, with a beating heart, into Miss Marlett's
      chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Margaret!" said Miss Marlett, holding out her hands. She was
      standing up in the middle of the boudoir. She ought to have been sitting
      grimly, fortified behind her bureau; that was the position in which she
      generally received pupils on these gloomy occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Margaret!" she repeated. The girl trembled a little as the
      school-mistress drew her closer, and made her sit down on a sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened?" she asked. Her lips were so dry that she could
      scarcely speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must make up your mind to be very brave. Your father&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it an accident?" asked Margaret, suddenly. She knew pretty well what
      was coming. Often she had foreseen the end, which it needed no prophet to
      foretell. "Was it anything very dreadful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Maitland does not say. You are to be called for to-day. Poor Daisy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miss Marlett, I am so very unhappy!" the girl sobbed. Somehow she was
      kneeling now, with her head buried in the elder lady's lap. "I have been
      horrid to you. I am so wretched!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A little kindness and a sudden trouble had broken down Miss Margaret
      Shields. For years she had been living, like Dr. Johnson at college, with
      a sad and hungry heart, trying to "carry it off by her wild talk and her
      wit." "It was bitterness they mistook for frolic." She had known herself
      to be a kind of outcast, and she determined to hold her own with the other
      girls who had homes and went to them in the holidays. Margaret had not
      gone home for a year. She had learned much, working harder than they knew;
      she had been in the "best set" among the pupils, by dint of her cheery
      rebelliousness. Now she suddenly felt all her loneliness, and knew, too,
      that she had been living, socially, in that little society at the expense
      of this kind queer old Miss Marlett's feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been horrid to you," she repeated. "I wish I had never been born."
    </p>
    <p>
      The school-mistress said nothing at all, but kept stroking the girl's
      beautiful head. Surreptitiously Miss Marlett wiped away a frosty tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mind me," at last Miss Marlett said. "I never thought hardly of
      you; I understood. Now you must go and get ready for your journey; you can
      have any of the girls you like to help you to pack."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Marlett carried generosity so far that she did not even ask which of
      the girls was to be chosen for this service. Perhaps she guessed that it
      was the other culprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Margaret rose and dried her eyes, and Miss Marlett took her in her
      arms and kissed her and went off to order a travelling luncheon and to
      select the warmest railway rug she could find; for the teacher, though she
      was not a very learned nor judicious school-mistress, had a heart and
      affections of her own. She had once, it is true, taken the word <i>legibus</i>
      (dative plural of lex, a law) for an adjective of the third declension,
      legibus, legiba, legibum; and Margaret had criticised this grammatical
      subtlety with an unsparing philological acumen, as if she had been
      Professor Moritz Haupt and Miss Marlett, Orelli. And this had led to the
      end of Latin lessons at the Dovecot, wherefore Margaret was honored as a
      goddess by girls averse to studying the classic languages. But now Miss
      Marlett forgot these things, and all the other skirmishes of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret went wearily to her room, where she bathed her face with cold
      water; it could not be too cold for her, A certain numb forgetfulness
      seemed to steep her mind while she was thus deadening her eyes again and
      again. She felt as if she never wished to raise her eyes from this
      chilling consolation. Then, when she thought she had got lid of all the
      traces of her trouble, she went cautiously to the back music-room. Janey
      was there, moping alone, drumming on the window-pane with her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to my room, Janey," she said, beckoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, to consort together in their bedrooms during school-hours was
      forbidden to the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, well only get into another scrape," said Janey, ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, come away; I've got leave for you. You're to help me to pack"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To pack!" cried Janey. "Why, <i>you're</i> not expelled, are you? You've
      done nothing. You've not even had a perfectly harmless letter from a boy
      who is just like a brother to you and whom you've known for years."
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret only beckoned again and turned away, Janey following in silence
      and intense curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached their room, where Margaret's portmanteau had already
      been placed, the girl began to put up such things as she would need for a
      short journey. She said nothing till she had finished, and then she sat
      down on a bed and told Janey what she had learned; and the pair "had a
      good cry," and comforted each other as well as they might.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what are you going to do?" asked Janey, when, as Homer says, "they
      had taken their fill of chilling lamentations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you no one else in all the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one at all. My mother died when I was a little child, in Smyrna. Since
      then we have wandered all about; we were a long time in Algiers, and we
      were at Marseilles, and then in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have a guardian, haven't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; he sent me here. And, of course, he's been very kind, and done
      everything for me; but he's quite a young man, not thirty, and he's so
      stupid, and so stiff, and thinks so much about Oxford, and talks so like a
      book. And he's so shy, and always seems to do everything, not because he
      likes it, but because he thinks he ought to. And, besides&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Margaret did not go further in her confessions, nor explain more
      lucidly why she had scant affection for Mait-land of St. Gatien's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And had your poor father no other friends who could take care of you?"
      Janey asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was a gentleman who called now and then; I saw him twice. He had
      been an officer in father's ship, I think, or had known him long ago at
      sea. He found us out somehow in Chelsea. There was no one else at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you don't know any of your father's family?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Margaret, wearily. "Ob, I have forgotten to pack up my
      prayer-book." And she took up a little worn volume in black morocco with
      silver clasps. "This was a book my father gave me," she said. "It has a
      name on it&mdash;my grandfather's, I suppose&mdash;'Richard Johnson,
      Linkheaton, 1837.'" Then she put the book in a pocket of her travelling
      cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother's father it may have belonged to," said Janey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," Margaret replied, looking out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you won't stay away long, dear," said Janey, affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But <i>you</i> are going, too, you know," Margaret answered, without much
      tact; and Janey, reminded of her private griefs, was about to break down,
      when the wheels of a carriage were heard laboring slowly up the snow-laden
      drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, here's some one coming!" cried Janey, rushing to the window. "Two
      horses! and a gentleman all in furs. Oh, Margaret, this must be for you!"
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;Flown.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Maitland's reflections as, in performance of the promise he had
      telegraphed, he made his way to the Dovecot were deep and distracted. The
      newspapers with which he had littered the railway carriage were left
      unread: he had occupation enough in his own thoughts. Men are so made that
      they seldom hear even of a death without immediately considering its
      effects on their private interests. Now, the death of Richard Shields
      affected Maitland's purposes both favorably and unfavorably. He had for
      some time repented of the tacit engagement (tacit as far as the girl was
      concerned) which bound him to Margaret. For some time he had been dimly
      aware of quite novel emotions in his own heart, and of a new, rather
      painful, rather pleasant, kind of interest in another lady. Maitland, in
      fact, was becoming more human than he gave himself credit for, and a sign
      of his awakening nature was the blush with which he had greeted, some
      weeks before, Barton's casual criticism on Mrs. St. John Deloraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any well-defined ideas or hopes, Maitland had felt that his
      philanthropic entanglement&mdash;it was rather, he said to himself, an
      entanglement than an engagement&mdash;had become irksome to his fancy. Now
      that the unfortunate parent was out of the way, he felt that the daughter
      would not be more sorry than himself to revise the relations in which they
      stood to each other. Vanity might have prevented some men from seeing
      this; but Maitland had not vitality enough for a healthy conceit. A
      curious "aloofness" of nature permitted him to stand aside, and see
      himself much as a young lady was likely to see him. This disposition is
      rare, and not a source of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, his future relations to Margaret formed a puzzle
      inextricable. He could not at all imagine how he was to dispose of so
      embarrassing a <i>protégée</i>. Margaret was becoming too much of a woman
      to be left much longer at school; and where was she to be disposed of?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might send her to Girton," he thought; and then, characteristically, he
      began to weigh in his mind the comparative educational merits of Girton
      and Somerville Hall. About one thing only was he certain: he must consult
      his college mentor, Bielby of St. Gatien's, as soon as might be. Too long
      had this Rasselas&mdash;occupied, like the famous Prince of Abyssinia,
      with <i>the choice of life</i>&mdash;neglected to resort to his academic
      Imlac. In the meantime he could only reflect that Margaret must remain as
      a pupil at Miss Marlett's. The moment would soon be arriving when some
      other home, and a chaperon instead of a school-mistress, must be found for
      this peculiar object of philanthropy and outdoor relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland was sorry he had not left town by the nine o'clock train. The
      early dusk began to gather, gray and damp; the train was late, having made
      tardy progress through the half-melted snow. He had set out from
      Paddington by the half-past ten express, and a glance at the harsh and
      crabbed page of Bradshaw will prove to the most sceptical that Maitland
      could not reach Tiverton much before six. Half frozen, and in anything but
      a happy temper, he engaged a fly, and drove off, along heavy miserable
      roads, to the Dovecot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the closed and barred gates of that vestal establishment,
      Maitland's cabman "pulled, and pushed, and kicked, and knocked" for a
      considerable time, without manifest effect. Clearly the retainers of Miss
      Marlett had secured the position for the night, and expected no visitors,
      though Maitland knew that he ought to be expected. "The bandogs bayed and
      howled," as they did round the secret bower of the Lady of Brauksome; and
      lights flitted about the windows. When a lantern at last came flickering
      up to the gate, the bearer of it stopped to challenge an apparently
      unlooked-for and unwelcome stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you? What do you want?" said a female voice, in a strong Devonian
      accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want Miss Marlett," answered Maitland.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some hesitation. Then the porter appeared to reflect that a
      burglar would not arrive in a cab, and that a surreptitious lover would
      not ask for the schoolmistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portals were at length unbarred and lugged apart over the gravel, and
      Maitland followed the cook (for she was no one less) and the candle up to
      the front door. He gave his card, and was ushered into the chamber
      reserved for interviews with parents and guardians. The drawing-room had
      the air and faint smell of a room very seldom occupied. All the chairs
      were so elegantly and cunningly constructed that they tilted up at
      intervals, and threw out the unwary male who trusted himself to their
      hospitality. Their backs were decorated with antimacassars wrought with
      glass beads, and these, in the light of one dip, shone fitfully with a
      frosty lustre. On the round table in the middle were volumes of "The
      Mothers of England," "The Grandmothers of the Bible," Blair "On the
      Grave," and "The Epic of Hades," the latter copiously and appropriately
      illustrated. In addition to these cheerful volumes there were large tomes
      of lake and river scenery, with gilt edges and faded magenta bindings,
      shrouded from the garish light of day in drab paper covers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls, of a very faint lilac tint, were hung with prize sketches, in
      water colors or in pencil, by young ladies who had left. In the former
      works of art, distant nature was represented as, on the whole, of a mauve
      hue, while the foreground was mainly composed of burnt-umber rocks,
      touched up with orange. The shadows in the pencil drawings had an
      agreeably brilliant polish, like that which, when conferred on fenders by
      Somebody's Patent Dome-Blacklead, "increases the attractions of the
      fireside," according to the advertisements. Maitland knew all the
      blacklead caves, broad-hatted brigands, and pea-green trees. They were old
      acquaintances, and as he fidgeted about the room he became very impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the door opened, and Miss Marlett appeared, rustling in silks,
      very stiff, and with an air of extreme astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Maitland?" she said, in an interrogative tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you expect me? Didn't you get my telegram?" asked Maitland.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to him that the storm might have injured the wires, that his
      message might never have arrived, and that he might be obliged to explain
      everything, and break his bad news in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly. I got <i>both</i> your telegrams. But why have you come
      here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, to see Margaret Shields, of course, and consult you about her. But
      what do you mean by <i>both</i> my telegrams?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Marlett turned very pale, and sat down with unexpected suddenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what will become of the poor girl?" she cried, "and what will become
      of <i>me</i>? It will get talked about. The parents will hear of it, and I
      am ruined."
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate lady passed her handkerchief over her eyes, to the extreme
      discomfiture of Maitland. He could not bear to see a woman cry; and that
      Miss Marlett should cry&mdash;Miss Marlett, the least melting, as he had
      fancied, of her sex&mdash;was a circumstance which entirely puzzled and
      greatly disconcerted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained silent, looking at a flower in the pattern of the carpet, for
      at least a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came here to consult you, Miss Marlett, about what is to become of the
      poor girl; but I do not see how the parents of the other young ladies are
      concerned. Death is common to all; and Margaret's father, though his life
      was exposed to criticism, cannot be fairly censured because he has left it
      And what do you mean, please, by receiving <i>both</i> my telegrams? I
      only #sent <i>one</i>, to the effect that I would leave town by the 10.30
      train, and come straight to you. There must be some mistake somewhere. Can
      I see Miss Shields?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See Miss Shields! Why, she's <i>gone!</i> She left this morning with your
      friend," said Miss Marlett, raising a face at once mournful and alarmed,
      and looking straight at her visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's <i>gone!</i> She left this morning with my friend!" repeated
      Maitland. He felt like a man in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said in your first telegram that you would come for her yourself, and
      in your second that you were detained, and that your friend and her
      father's friend, Mr. Lithgow, would call for her by the early train; so
      she went with <i>him</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, Mr. Lithgow! I have no friend, Mr. lithgow," cried Maitland;
      "and I sent no second telegram."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then who <i>did</i> send it, sir, if you please? For I will show you both
      telegrams," cried Miss Marlett, now on her defence; and rising, she left
      the room.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
While Miss Marlett was absent, in search of the telegrams, Maitland had
time to reflect on the unaccountable change in the situation. What had
become of Margaret? Who had any conceivable interest in removing her
from school at the very moment of her father's accidental death? And by
what possible circumstances of accident or fraud could two messages from
himself have arrived, when he was certain that he had only sent one?
The records of somnambulism contain no story of a person who despatched
telegrams while walking in his sleep. Then the notion occurred to
Maitland that his original despatch, as he wrote it, might have been
mislaid in the office, and that the imaginative clerk who lost it might
have filled it up from memory, and, like the examinees in the poem,
might

     "Have wrote it all by rote,
     And never wrote it right."
</pre>
    <p>
      But the fluttering approach of such an hypothesis was dispersed by the
      recollection that Margaret had actually departed, and (what was worse) had
      gone off with "his friend, Mr. Lithgow." Clearly, no amount of accident or
      mistake would account for the appearance of Mr. Lithgow, and the
      disappearance of Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of Maitland that within himself he did not greatly
      blame the schoolmistress. He had so little human nature&mdash;as he
      admitted, on the evidence of his old college tutor&mdash;that he was never
      able to see things absolutely and entirely from the point of view of his
      own interests. His own personality was not elevated enough to command the
      whole field of human conduct. He was always making allowances for people,
      and never felt able to believe himself absolutely in the right, and
      everyone else absolutely in the wrong. Had he owned a more full-blooded
      life, he would probably have lost his temper, and "spoken his mind," as
      the saying is, to poor Miss Marlett She certainly should never have let
      Margaret go with a stranger, on the authority even of a telegram from the
      girl's guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck Maitland, finally, that Miss Marlett was very slow about finding
      the despatches. She had been absent quite a quarter of an hour. At last
      she returned, pale and trembling, with a telegraphic despatch in her hand,
      but not alone. She was accompanied by a blonde and agitated young lady, in
      whom Maitland, having seen her before, might have recognized Miss Janey
      Harman. But he had no memory for faces, and merely bowed vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is Miss Harman, whom I think you have seen on other occasions," said
      Miss Marlett, trying to be calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland bowed again, and wondered more than ever. It did occur to him,
      that the fewer people knew of so delicate a business the better for
      Margaret's sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have brought Miss Harman here, Mr. Maitland, partly because she is Miss
      Shields' greatest friend" (here Janey sobbed), "but chiefly because she
      can prove, to a certain extent, the truth of what I have told you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never for a moment doubted it, Miss Marlett; but will you kindly let me
      compare the two telegrams? This is a most extraordinary affair, and we
      ought to lose no time in investigating it, and discovering its meaning.
      You and I are responsible, you know, to ourselves, if unfortunately to no
      one else, for Margaret's safety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I haven't got the two telegrams!" exclaimed poor Miss Marlett, who
      could not live up to the stately tone of Maitland. "I haven't got them, or
      rather, I only have one of them, and I have hunted everywhere, high and
      low, for the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she offered Maitland a single dispatch, and the flimsy pink paper
      fluttered in her shaking hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland took it up and read aloud:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Sent out at 7.45.    Received 7.51.
     "From Robert Maitland to Miss Marlett.
     "The Dovecot, Conisbeare,
     "Tiverton.
     "I come to-morrow, leaving by 10.30 train.
     Do not let Margaret see the newspaper.
     Her father dead. Break news."
</pre>
    <p>
      "Why, that is my own telegram!" cried Maitland; "but what have you done
      with the other you said you received?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the very one I cannot find, though I had both on the escritoire
      in my own room this morning. I cannot believe anyone would touch it. I did
      not lock them away, not expecting to have any use for them; but I am quite
      sure, the last time I saw them, they were lying there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is very extraordinary," said Maitland. "You tell me, Miss Marlett,
      that you received two telegrams from me. On the strength of the later of
      the two you let your pupil go away with a person of whom you know nothing,
      and then you have not even the telegram to show me. How long an interval
      was there between the receipt of the two despatches?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got them both at once," said poor, trembling Miss Marlett, who felt the
      weakness of her case. "They were both sent up with the letters this
      morning. Were they not, Miss Harman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Janey; "I certainly saw two telegraphic envelopes lying among
      your letters at breakfast. I mentioned it to&mdash;to poor Margaret," she
      added, with a break in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why were the telegrams not delivered last night?" Maitland asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have left orders," Miss Marlett answered, "that only telegrams of
      instant importance are to be sent on at once. It costs twelve shillings,
      and parents and people are so tiresome, always telegraphing about nothing
      in particular, and costing a fortune. These telegrams <i>were</i> very
      important, of course; but nothing more could have been done about them if
      they had arrived last night, than if they came this morning. I have had a
      great deal of annoyance and expense," the schoolmistress added, "with
      telegrams that had to be paid for."
    </p>
    <p>
      And here most people who live at a distance from telegraph offices, and
      are afflicted with careless friends whose touch on the wire is easy and
      light, will perhaps sympathize with Miss Marlett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might at least have telegraphed back to ask me to confirm the
      instructions, when you read the second despatch," said Maitland.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was beginning to take an argumentative interest in the strength of his
      own case. It was certainly very strong, and the excuse for the
      schoolmistress was weak in proportion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that would have been of no use, as it happens," Janey put in&mdash;an
      unexpected and welcome ally to Miss Marlett&mdash;"because you must have
      left Paddington long before the question could have reached you."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was unanswerable, as a matter of fact; and Miss Marlett could not
      repress a grateful glance in the direction of her wayward pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Maitland, "it is all very provoking, and very serious. Can
      you remember at all how the second message ran, Miss Marlett?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I know it off by heart; it was directed exactly like that in your
      hand, and was dated half an hour later. It ran: 'Plans altered. Margaret
      required in town. My friend and her father's, Mr. Lithgow, will call for
      her soon after mid-day. I noticed there were just twenty words."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did you also notice the office from which the message was sent out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Miss Marlett, shaking her head with an effort at recollection.
      "I am afraid I did not notice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very unfortunate," said Maitland, walking vaguely up and down the
      room. "Do you think the telegram is absolutely lost?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have looked everywhere, and asked all the maids."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did you see it last, for certain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I laid both despatches on the desk in my room when I went out to make
      sure that Margaret had everything comfortable before she started."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where was this Mr. Lithgow then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was sitting over the fire in my room, trying to warm himself; he
      seemed very cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clearly, then, Mr. Lithgow is now in possession of the telegram, which he
      probably, or rather certainly, sent himself. But how he came to know
      anything about the girl, or what possible motive he can have had&mdash;"
      muttered Maitland to himself. "She has never been in any place, Miss
      Marlett, since she came to you, where she could have made the man's
      acquaintance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is impossible to say whom girls may meet, and how they may manage it,
      Mr. Maitland," said Miss Marlett sadly; when Janey broke in:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am <i>sure</i> Margaret never met him here. She was not a girl to have
      such a secret, and she could not have acted a part so as to have taken me
      in. I saw him first, out of the window. Margaret was very unhappy; she had
      been crying. I said, 'Here's a gentleman in furs, Margaret; he must have
      come for you.' Then she looked out and said, 'It is not my guardian; it is
      the gentleman whom I saw twice with my father.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of a man was he to look at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was tall, and dark, and rather good-looking, with a slight black
      mustache. He had a fur collar that went up to his eyes almost, and he was
      not a young man. He was a gentleman," said Janey, who flattered herself
      that she recognized such persons as bear without reproach that grand old
      name&mdash;when she saw them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you know him again if you met him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anywhere," said Janey; "and I would know his voice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wore mourning," said Miss Marlett, "and he told me he had known
      Margaret's father. I heard him say a few words to her, in a very kind way,
      about him. That seemed more comfort to Margaret than anything. 'He did not
      suffer at all, my dear,' he said. He spoke to her in that way, as an older
      man might."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, how on earth could <i>he</i> know?" cried Maitland. "No one was
      present when her poor father died. His body was found in a&mdash;," and
      Maitland paused rather awkwardly. There was, perhaps, no necessity for
      adding to the public information about the circumstances of Mr. Shields'
      decease. "He was overcome by the cold and snow, I mean, on the night of
      the great storm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have always heard that the death of people made drowsy by snow and
      fatigue is as painless as sleep," said Miss Marlett with some tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose that is what the man must have meant," Maitland answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing more to be said on either side, and yet he lingered,
      trying to think over any circumstance which might lend a clew in the
      search for Margaret and of the mysterious Mr. Lithgow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he said "Good-night," after making the superfluous remark that it
      would be as well to let everyone suppose that nothing unusual or
      unexpected had happened. In this view Miss Marlett entirely concurred, for
      excellent reasons of her own, and now she began to regret that she had
      taken Miss Harman into her counsels. But there was no help for it; and
      when Maitland rejoined his cabman (who had been refreshed by tea), a kind
      of informal treaty of peace was concluded between Janey and the
      schoolmistress. After all, it appeared to Miss Marlett (and correctly)
      that the epistle from the young officer whom Janey regarded as a brother
      was a natural and harmless communication. It chiefly contained accounts of
      contemporary regimental sports and pastimes, in which the writer had
      distinguished himself, and if it did end "Yours affectionately," there was
      nothing very terrible or inflammatory in that, all things considered. So
      the fair owner of the letter received it into her own keeping, only she
      was "never to do it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Marlett did not ask Janey to say nothing about Margaret's
      inexplicable adventure. She believed that the girl would have sufficient
      sense and good feeling to hold her peace; and if she did not do so of her
      own accord, no vows would be likely to bind her. In this favorable
      estimate of her pupil's discretion Miss Marlett was not mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janey did not even give herself airs of mystery among the girls, which was
      an act of creditable self-denial. The rest of the school never doubted
      that, on the death of Miss Shields' father, she had been removed by one of
      her friends. As for Maitland, he was compelled to pass the night at
      Tiverton, revolving many memories. He had now the gravest reason for
      anxiety about the girl, of whom he was the only friend and protector, and
      who was, undeniably, the victim of some plot or conspiracy. Nothing more
      practical than seeking the advice of Bielby of St. Gatien's occurred to
      his perplexed imagination.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;At St. Gatien's.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following day was spent by Maitland in travel, and in pushing such
      inquiries as suggested themselves to a mind not fertile in expedients. He
      was not wholly unacquainted with novels of adventure, and he based his
      conduct, as much as possible, on what he could remember in these
      "authorities." For example, he first went in search of the man who had
      driven the cab which brought the mysterious Mr. Lithgow to flutter the
      Dovecot. So far, there was no difficulty. One of the cabdrivers who plied
      at the station perfectly remembered the gentleman in furs whom he had
      driven to the school After waiting at the school till the young lady was
      ready, he had conveyed them back again to the station, and they took the
      up-train. That was all <i>he</i> knew. The gentleman, if his opinion were
      asked, was "a scaly varmint." On inquiry, Maitland found that this wide
      moral generalization was based on the limited <i>pour-boire</i> which Mr.
      Lithgow had presented to his charioteer. Had the gentleman any luggage?
      Yes, he had a portmanteau, which he left in the cloak-room, and took away
      with him on his return to town&mdash;not in the van, in the railway
      carriage. "What could he want with all that luggage?" Maitland wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing was, of course, to find the guard of the train which
      conveyed Margaret and her mysterious friend to Taunton. This official had
      seen the gentleman and the young lady get out at Taunton. They went on to
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate guardian of Margaret Shields was now obliged to start for
      Taunton, and thence pursue his way, and his inquiries, as far as
      Paddington. The position was extremely irksome to Maitland. Although, in
      novels, gentlemen often assume the <i>rôle</i> of the detective with
      apparent relish, Maitland was not cast by Nature for the part. He was too
      scrupulous and too shy. He detested asking guards, and porters, and
      station-masters, and people in refreshment-rooms if they remembered having
      seen, yesterday, a gentleman in a fur coat travelling with a young lady,
      of whom he felt that he had to offer only a too suggestive description.
      The philanthropist could not but see that everyone properly constructed,
      in imagination, a satisfactory little myth to account for all the
      circumstances&mdash;a myth in which Maitland played the unpopular part of
      the Avenging Brother or Injured Husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      What other path, indeed, was open to conjecture? A gentleman in a fur
      coat, and a young lady of prepossessing appearance, are travelling alone
      together, one day, in a carriage marked "Engaged." Next day, another
      gentleman (not prepossessing, and very nervous) appears on the same route,
      asking anxious questions about the wayfarer in the notable coat (bearskin,
      it seemed to have been) and about the interesting young lady. Clearly, the
      pair were the fond fugitives of Love; while the pursuer represented the
      less engaging interests of Property, of Law, and of the Family. All the
      romance and all the popular interest were manifestly on the other side,
      not on Maitland's side. Even his tips were received without enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland felt these disadvantages keenly; and yet he had neither the time
      nor the power to explain matters. Even if he had told everyone he met that
      he was really the young lady's guardian, and that the gentleman in the fur
      coat was (he had every reason to believe) a forger and a miscreant, he
      would not have been believed. His opinion would, not unjustly, have been
      looked on as distorted by what Mr. Herbert Spencer calls "the personal
      bias." He had therefore to put up with general distrust and brief
      discourteous replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many young ladies in the refreshment-bar at Swindon. There they
      gather, numerous and fair as the sea-nymphs&mdash;Doto, Proto, Doris, and
      Panope, and beautiful Galatea. Of them Maitland sought to be instructed.
      But the young ladies were arch and uncommunicative, pretending that their
      attention was engaged in their hospitable duties. Soup it was their
      business to minister to travellers, not private information. They <i>had</i>
      seen the gentleman and lady. Very attentive to her he seemed. Yes, they
      were on the best terms: "very sweet on each other," one young lady
      averred, and then secured her retreat and concealed her blushes by
      ministering to the wants of a hungry and hurried public. All this was
      horribly disagreeable to Maitland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland finally reached Paddington, still asking questions. He had
      telegraphed the night before to inquire whether two persons answering to
      the oft-repeated description had been noticed at the terminus. He had
      received a reply in the negative before leaving Tiverton. Here, then, was
      a check. If the ticket-collector was to be credited, the objects of his
      search had reached Westbourne Park, where their tickets had been taken.
      There, however, all the evidence proved that they had not descended.
      Nobody had seen them alight Yet, not a trace was to be found at Paddington
      of a gentleman in a fur coat, nor of any gentleman travelling alone with a
      young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly nine o'clock when Maitland, puzzled, worn out, and
      disgusted, arrived in town. He did what he could in the way of
      interrogating the porters&mdash;all to no purpose. In the crowd and bustle
      of passengers, who skirmish for their luggage under inadequate lights, no
      one remembered having seen either of the persons whom Maitland described.
      There remained the chance of finding out and cross-examining all the
      cab-drivers who had taken up passengers by the late trains the night
      before. But that business could not be transacted at the moment, nor
      perhaps by an amateur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland's time was limited indeed. He had been obliged to get out at
      Westbourne Park and prosecute his inquisition there. Thence he drove to
      Paddington, and, with brief enough space for investigations that yielded
      nothing, he took his ticket by the 9.15 evening train for Oxford. His
      whole soul was set on consulting Bielby of St. Gatien's, whom, in his
      heart, Maitland could not but accuse of being at the bottom of all these
      unprecedented troubles. If Bielby had not driven him, as it were, out of
      Oxford, by urging him to acquire a wider knowledge of humanity, and to
      expand his character by intercourse with every variety of our fallen
      species, Maitland felt that he might now be vegetating in an existence
      peaceful, if not well satisfied. "Adventures are to the adventurous." It
      is a hard thing when they have to be achieved by a champion who is not
      adventurous at all. If he had not given up his own judgment to Bielby's,
      Maitland told himself he never would have plunged into philanthropic
      enterprise, he never would have taken the <i>Hit or Miss</i> he never
      would have been entangled in the fortunes of Margaret Shields, and he
      would not now be concerned with the death, in the snow, of a dissipated
      old wanderer, nor obliged to hunt down a runaway or kidnapped school-girl.
      Nor would he be suffering the keen and wearing anxiety of speculating on
      what had befallen Margaret.

      His fancy suggested the most gloomy yet plausible solutions of the mystery
      of her disappearance. In spite of these reflections, Maitland's confidence
      in the sagacity of his old tutor was unshaken. Bielby had not been
      responsible for the details of the methods by which his pupil was trying
      to expand his character. Lastly, he reflected that if he had not taken
      Bielby's advice, and left Oxford, he never would have known Mrs. St. John
      Deloraine, the lady of his diffident desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the time passed, the minutes flitting by, like the telegraph posts, in
      the dark, and Maitland reached the familiar Oxford Station. He jumped into
      a hansom, and said, "Gatien's." Past Worcester, up Carfax, down the High
      Street, they struggled through the snow; and at last Maitland got out and
      kicked at the College gate. The porter (it was nearly midnight) opened it
      with rather a scared face:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horful row on in quad, sir," he said. "The young gentlemen 'as a bonfire
      on, and they're a larking with the snow. Orful A they're a making, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The agricultural operation thus indicated by the porter was being
      forwarded with great vigor. A number of young men, in every variety of
      garb (from ulsters to boating-coats), were energetically piling up a huge
      Alp of snow against the door of the Master's lodge. Meanwhile, another
      band had carried into the quad all the light tables and cane chairs from a
      lecture-room. Having arranged these in a graceful pyramidal form, they
      introduced some of the fire-lighters, called "devils" by the College
      servants, and set a match to the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland stood for a moment in doubt, looking, in the lurid glare, very
      like a magician who has raised an army of fiends, and cannot find work for
      them. He felt no disposition to interfere, though the venerable mass of St
      Ga-tien's seemed in momentary peril, and the noise was enough to waken the
      dead, let alone the Bursar of Oriel. But Maitland was a non-resident
      Fellow, known only to the undergraduates, where he was known at all, as a
      "Radical," with any number of decorative epithets, according to the taste
      and fancy of the speaker. He did not think he could identify any of the
      rioters, and he was not certain that they would not carry him to his room,
      and there screw him up, according to precedent. Maitland had too much
      sense of personal dignity to face the idea of owing his escape from his
      chambers to the resources of civilization at the command of the college
      blacksmith. He, therefore, after a moment of irresolution, stole off under
      a low-browed old door-way communicating with a queer black many-sided
      little quadrangle; for it is by no means necessary that a quadrangle
      should, in this least mathematical of universities, be quadrangular.
      Groping and stumbling his familiar way up the darkest of spiral
      staircases, Maitland missed his footing, and fell, with the whole weight
      of his body, against the door at which he had meant to knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in," said a gruff voice, as if the knocking had been done in the
      most conventional manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland had come in by this time, and found the distinguished Mr. Bielby,
      Fellow of St. Gatien's, sitting by his fireside, attired in a gray
      shooting-coat, and busy with a book and a pipe. This gentleman had, on
      taking his degree, gone to town, and practised with singular success at
      the Chancery Bar. But on some sudden disgust or disappointment, he threw
      up his practice, returned to College, and there lived a retired life among
      his "brown Greek manuscripts." He was a man of the world, turned hermit,
      and the first of the kind whom Maitland had ever known. He had "coached"
      Maitland, though he usually took no pupils, and remained his friend and
      counsellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, Maitland?" said the student, without rising. "I thought,
      from the way in which you knocked, that you were some of the young men,
      coming to 'draw me,' as I think they call it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bielby smiled as he spoke. He knew that the undergraduates were as
      likely to "draw" him as boys who hunt a hare are likely to draw a fierce
      old bear that "dwells among bones and blood."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bielby's own environment, to be sure, was not of the grisly and
      mortuary character thus energetically described by the poet His pipe was
      in his hand. His broad, bald, red face, ending in an auburn spade-shaped
      beard, wore the air of content. Around him were old books that had
      belonged to famous students of old&mdash;Scaliger, Meursius, Muretus&mdash;and
      before him lay the proof-sheets of his long-deferred work, a new critical
      edition of "Demetrius of Scepsis."
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at his friend, Maitland envied the learned calm of a man who had
      not contrived, in the task of developing his own human nature, to become
      involved, like his pupil, in a singular and deplorable conjuncture of
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The men are making a terrible riot in quad," he said, answering the
      other's remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," replied Bielby, genially; "boys will be boys, and so will
      young men. I believe our Torpid has bumped Keble, and the event is being
      celebrated."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there came a terrific howl from without, and a crash of broken glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There go some windows into their battels," said Mr. Bielby. "They will
      hear of this from the Provost But what brings you here, Maitland, so
      unexpectedly? Very glad to see you, whatever it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir," said Maitland, "I rather want to ask your advice on an
      important matter. The fact is, to begin at the beginning of a long story,
      that some time ago I got, more or less, engaged to be married."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not a very ardent or lover-like announcement, but Bielby seemed
      gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah-ha," replied the tutor, with a humorous twinkle. "Happy to hear it
      Indeed, I <i>had</i> heard a rumor, a whisper! A little bird, as they say,
      brought a hint of it&mdash;I hope, Maitland, a happy omen! A pleasant
      woman of the world, one who can take her own part in society, and your
      part, too, a little&mdash;if you will let me say so&mdash;is exactly what
      you need. I congratulate you very heartily. And are we likely to see the
      young lady in Oxford? Where is she just now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland saw that the learned Bielby had indeed heard something, and not
      the right thing. He flushed all over as he thought of the truth, and of
      Mrs. St John Deloraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I wish I knew," said Maitland at last, beginning to find this
      consulting of the oracle a little difficult. "The fact is, that's just
      what I wanted to consult you about. I&mdash;I'm afraid I've lost all
      traces of the young lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what do you mean?" asked the don, his face suddenly growing grave,
      while his voice had not yet lost its humorous tone. "She has not eloped?
      You don't mean to tell me she has run away from you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really don't know what to say," answered Maitland. "I'm afraid she has
      been run away with, that she is the victim of some plot or conspiracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You surely can't mean what you say" (and now the voice was gruffer than
      ever). "People don't plot and conspire nowadays, if ever they did, which
      probably they didn't! And who are the young lady's people? Why don't they
      look after her? I had heard she was a widow, but she must have friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is not a widow&mdash;she is an orphan," said Maitland, blushing
      painfully. "I am her guardian in a kind of way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, the wrong stories have reached me altogether! I'm sure I beg your
      pardon, but did you tell me her name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her name is Shields&mdash;Margaret Shields"&mdash;("Not the name I was
      told," muttered Bielby)&mdash;"and her father was a man who had been
      rather unsuccessful in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was his profession, what did he do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had been a sailor, I think," said the academic philanthropist; "but
      when I knew him he had left the sea, and was, in fact, as far as he was
      anything, a professional tattooer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He tattooed patterns on sailors and people of that class for a
      livelihood."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bielby sat perfectly silent for a few minutes, and no one who saw him
      could doubt that his silence arose from a conscious want of words on a
      level with the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Miss&mdash;h'm, Spears&mdash;Shields? thank you; has she been an
      orphan long?" he asked, at length. He was clearly trying to hope that the
      most undesirable prospective father-in-law described by Maitland had long
      been removed from the opportunity of forming his daughter's character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only heard of his death yesterday," said Maitland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it sudden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes. The fact is, he was a man of rather irregular habits, and he
      was discovered dead in one of the carts belonging to the Vestry of St
      George's, Hanover Square."
    </p>
    <p>
      "St. George's, Hanover Square, indeed!" said the don, and once more he
      relapsed, after a long whistle, into a significant silence. "Maitland," he
      said at last, "how did you come to be acquainted with these people? The
      father, as I understand, was a kind of artist; but you can't, surely, have
      met them in society?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He came a good deal to 'my public-house, the <i>Hit or Miss</i>. I think
      I told you about it, sir, and you rather seemed to approve of it. The
      tavern in Chelsea, if you remember, where I was trying to do something for
      the riverside population, and to mix with them for their good, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night!" growled Bielby, very abruptly, and with considerable
      determination in his tone. "I am rather busy this evening. I think you had
      better think no more about the young lady, and say nothing whatever about
      the matter to anyone. Good-night!".
    </p>
    <p>
      So speaking, the hermit lighted his pipe, which, in the astonishment
      caused by Maitland's avowals, he had allowed to go out, and he applied
      himself to a large old silver tankard. He was a scholar of the Cambridge
      school, and drank beer. Maitland knew his friend and mentor too well to
      try to prolong the conversation, and withdrew to his bleak college room,
      where a timid fire was smoking and crackling among the wet faggots, with a
      feeling that he must steer his own course in this affair. It was clearly
      quite out of the path of Bielby's experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet," thought Maitland, "if I had not taken his advice about trying
      to become more human, and taken that infernal public-house too, I never
      would have been in this hole."
    </p>
    <p>
      All day Maitland had scarcely tasted anything that might reasonably be
      called food. "He had eaten; he had not dined," to adopt the distinction of
      Brillat-Savarin. He had been dependent on the gritty and flaccid
      hospitalities of refreshment-rooms, on the sandwich and the bun. Now he
      felt faint as well as weary; but, rummaging amidst his cupboards, he could
      find no provisions more tempting and nutritious than a box of potted
      shrimps, from the college stores, and a bottle of some Hungarian vintage
      sent by an advertising firm to the involuntary bailees of St. Gatien's.
      Maitland did not feel equal to tackling these delicacies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not forget that he had neglected to answer a note, on philanthropic
      business, from Mrs. St. John Deloraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weary as he was, he took pleasure in replying at length, and left the
      letter out for his scout to post. Then, with a heavy headache, he tumbled
      into bed, where, for that matter, he went on tumbling and tossing during
      the greater part of the night. About five o'clock he fell into a sleep
      full of dreams, only to be awakened, at six, by the steam-whooper, or
      "devil," a sweet boon with which his philanthropy had helped to endow the
      reluctant and even recalcitrant University of Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Instead of becoming human, I have only become humanitarian," Maitland
      seemed to hear his own thoughts whispering to himself in a night-mare.
      Through the slowly broadening winter dawn, in snatches of sleep that
      lasted, or seemed to last, five minutes at a time, Maitland felt the
      thought repeating itself, like some haunting refrain, with a feverish
      iteration.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;After the Inquest.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To be ill in college rooms, how miserable it is! Mainland's scout called
      him at half-past seven with the invariable question, "Do you breakfast
      out, sir?" If a man were in the condemned cell, his scout (if in
      attendance) would probably arouse him on the morning of his execution
      with, "Do you breakfast out, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Maitland, in reply to the changeless inquiry; "in common room
      as usual. Pack my bag, I am going down by the nine o'clock train."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he rose and tried to dress; but his head ached more than ever, his
      legs seemed to belong to someone else, and to be no subject of just
      complacency to their owner. He reeled as he strove to cross the room, then
      he struggled back into bed, where, feeling alternately hot and cold, he
      covered himself with his ulster, in addition to his blankets. Anywhere but
      in college, Maitland would, of course, have rung the bell and called his
      servant; but in our conservative universities, and especially in so
      reverend a pile as St. Gatiens, there was, naturally, no bell to ring.
      Maitland began to try to huddle himself into his greatcoat, that he might
      crawl to the window and shout to Dakyns, his scout.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment there fell most gratefully on his ear the sound of a
      strenuous sniff, repeated at short intervals in his sitting-room. Often
      had Maitland regretted the chronic cold and handkerchiefless condition of
      his bedmaker; but now her sniff was welcome as music, much more so than
      that of two hunting horns which ambitious sportsmen were trying to blow in
      quad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Trattles!" cried Maitland, and his own voice sounded faint in his
      ears. "Mrs. Trattles!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady thus invoked answered with becoming modesty, punctuated by
      sniffs, from the other side of the door:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; can I do anything for you, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call Dakyns, please," said Maitland, falling back on his pillow. "I don't
      feel very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dakyns appeared in due course.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to hear you're ill, sir; you do look a little flushed. Hadn't I
      better send for Mr. Whalley, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mr. Whalley was the doctor whom Oxford, especially the younger
      generation, delighted to honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I don't think you need. Bring me breakfast here. I think I'll be able
      to start for town by the 11.58. And bring me my letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, sir," answered Dakyns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with that fearless assumption of responsibility which always does an
      Englishman credit, he sent the college messenger in search of Mr. Whalley
      before he brought round Maitland's letters and his breakfast commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no letters bearing on the subject of Margaret's disappearance;
      if any such had been addressed to him, they would necessarily be, as
      Maitland remembered after his first feeling of disappointment, at his
      rooms in London. Neither Miss Marlett, if she had aught to communicate,
      nor anyone else, could be expected to know that Mait-land's first act
      would be to rush to Oxford and consult Bielby.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guardian of Margaret turned with no success to his breakfast commons;
      even tea appeared unwelcome and impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland felt very drowsy, dull, indifferent, when a knock came to his
      door, and Mr. Whalley entered. He could not remember having sent for him;
      but he felt that, as an invalid once said, "there was a pain somewhere in
      the room," and he was feebly pleased to see his physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very bad feverish cold," was the verdict, and Mr. Whalley would call
      again next day, till which time Maitland was forbidden to leave his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drowsed through the day, disturbed by occasional howls from the
      quadrangle, where the men were snowballing a little, and, later, by the
      scraping shovels of the navvies who had been sent in to remove the snow,
      and with it the efficient cause of nocturnal disorders in St. Gatien's.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the time passed, Maitland not being quite conscious of its passage, and
      each hour putting Margaret Shields more and more beyond the reach of the
      very few people who were interested in her existence. Maitland's illness
      took a more severe form than Whalley had anticipated, and the lungs were
      affected. Bielby was informed of his state, and came to see him; but
      Maitland talked so wildly about the <i>Hit or Miss</i>, about the man in
      the bearskin coat, and other unintelligible matters, that the hermit soon
      withdrew to the more comprehensible fragments of "Demetrius of Scepsis."
      He visited his old pupil daily, and behaved with real kindness; but the
      old implicit trust never revived with Maitland's returning health.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the fever abated. Maitland felt weak, yet perfectly conscious of
      what had passed, and doubly anxious about what was to be done, if there
      was, indeed, a chance of doing anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men of his own standing had by this time become aware that he was in
      Oxford, and sick, consequently there was always someone to look after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brown," said Maitland to a friend, on the fifth day after his illness
      began, "would you mind giving me my things? I'll try to dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      The experiment was so far successful that Maitland left the queer bare
      slit of a place called his bedroom (formed, like many Oxford bedrooms, by
      a partition added to the large single room of old times), and moved into
      the weirdly aesthetic study, decorated in the Early William Morris manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now will you howl for Dakyns, and make him have this telegram sent to the
      post? Awfully sorry to trouble you, but I can't howl yet for myself,"
      whispered Maitland, huskily, as he scribbled on a telegraph form.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delighted to howl for you," said Brown, and presently the wires were
      carrying a message to Barton in town. Maitland wanted to see him at once,
      on very pressing business. In a couple of hours there came a reply: Barton
      would be with Maitland by dinner-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghostly room, in the Early William Morris manner, looked cosey and
      even homelike when the lamp was lit, when the dusky blue curtains were
      drawn, and a monster of the deep&mdash;one of the famous Oxford soles,
      larger than you ever see them elsewhere&mdash;smoked between Maitland and
      Barton. Beside the latter stood a silver quart pot, full of "strong," a
      reminiscence of "the old coaching days," when Maitland had read with
      Barton for Greats. The invalid's toast and water wore an air of modest
      conviviality, and might have been mistaken for sherry by anyone who relied
      merely on such information as is furnished by the sense of sight The wing
      of a partridge (the remainder of the brace fell to Barton's lot) was
      disposed of by the patient; and then, over the wine, which he did not
      touch, and the walnuts, which he tried nervously to crack in his thin,
      white hands, Maitland made confession and sought advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly much easier talking to Barton than to Bielby, for Barton
      knew so much already, especially about the <i>Hit or Miss</i>; but when it
      came to the story of the guardianship of Margaret, and the kind of
      prospective engagement to that young lady, Barton rose and began to walk
      about the room. But the old beams creaked under him in the weak places;
      and Barton, seeing how much he discomposed Maitland, sat down again, and
      steadied his nerves with a glass of the famous St. Gatien's port.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when Maitland, in the orderly course of his narrative, came to the
      finding of poor Dick Shields' body in the snow-cart, Barton cried, "Why,
      you don't mean to say that was the man, the girl's father? By George, I
      can tell you something about <i>him</i>! At the inquest my partner, old
      Munby, made out&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has there been an inquest already? Oh, of course there must have been,"
      said Maitland, whose mind had run so much on Margaret's disappearance that
      he had given little of his thoughts (weak and inconsecutive enough of
      late) to the death of her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course there has been an inquest Have you not read the papers since
      you were ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Maitland had the common-room back numbers of the <i>Times</i> since
      the day of his return from Devonshire in his study at that very moment But
      his reading, so far, had been limited to the "Agony Column" of the
      advertisements (where he half hoped to find some message), and to all the
      paragraphs headed "Strange Occurrence" and "Mysterious Disappearance."
      None of these had cast any light on the fortunes of Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not seen anything about the inquest," he said. "What verdict did
      they bring in? The usual one, I suppose&mdash;'Visitation,' and all that
      kind of thing, or 'Death from exposure while under the influence of
      alcoholic stimulants.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's exactly what they made it," said Barton; "and I don't blame them;
      for the medical evidence my worthy partner gave left them no other choice.
      You can see what he said for yourself in the papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton had been turning over the file of the <i>Times</i>, and showed
      Maitland the brief record of the inquest and the verdict; matters so
      common that their chronicle might be, and perhaps is, kept stereotyped,
      with blanks for names and dates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A miserable end," said Maitland, when he had perused the paragraph. "And
      now I had better go on with my story? But what did you mean by saying you
      didn't 'blame' the coroner's jury?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any more story? Is it not enough? I don't know that I should
      tell you; it is too horrid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't keep anything from me, please," said Maitland, moving nervously. "I
      must know everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," answered Barton, his voice sinking to a tone of reluctant horror&mdash;"well,
      your poor friend was <i>murdered!</i> That's what I meant when I said I
      did not blame the jury; they could have given no other verdict than they
      did on the evidence of my partner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Murder! The very word has power to startle, as if the crime were a new
      thing, not as old (so all religions tell us) as the first brothers. As a
      meteoric stone falls on our planet, strange and unexplained, a waif of the
      universe, from a nameless system, so the horror of murder descends on us,
      when we meet it, with an alien dread, as of an intrusion from some lost
      star, some wandering world that is Hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Murdered!" cried Maitland. "Why, Barton, you must be dreaming! Who on
      earth could have murdered poor Shields? If ever there was a man who was no
      one's enemy but his own, that man was Shields! And he literally had
      nothing that anyone could have wanted to steal. I allowed him so much&mdash;a
      small sum&mdash;paid weekly, on Thursdays; and it was a Wednesday when he
      was&mdash;when he died. He could not have had a shilling at that moment in
      the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry to have to repeat it, but murdered he was, all the same,
      and that by a very cunning and cautious villain&mdash;a man, I should say,
      of some education.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how could it possibly have been done? There's the evidence before you
      in the paper. There was not a trace of violence on him, and the
      circumstances, which were so characteristic of his ways, were more than
      enough to account for his death. The exposure, the cold, the mere sleeping
      in the snow&mdash;it's well known to be fatal Why," said Maitland,
      eagerly, "in a long walk home from shooting in winter, I have had to send
      back a beater for one of the keepers; and we found him quite asleep, in a
      snowdrift, under a hedge. He never would have wakened."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was naturally anxious to refute the horrible conclusion which Barton
      had arrived at.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young doctor only shook his head. His opinion was manifestly fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can you possibly know better than the jury," urged Maitland
      peevishly, "and the coroner, and the medical officer for the district, who
      were all convinced that his death was perfectly natural&mdash;that he got
      drunk, lost his way, laid down in the cart, and perished of exposure? Why,
      you did not even hear the evidence. I can't make out," he went on, with
      the querulousness of an invalid, "why you should have come up just to talk
      such nonsense. The coroner and the jury are sure to have been right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see, it was not the coroner's business nor the jury's business,
      to know better than the medical officer for the district, on whose
      evidence they relied. But it is <i>my</i> business; for the said officer
      is my partner, and, but for me, our business would be worth very little.
      He is about as ignorant and easy-going an excellent old fellow as ever let
      a life slip out of his hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, if you knew so much, why didn't you keep him straight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as it happened, I was down in Surrey with my people, at a wedding,
      when the death occurred, and they made a rather superficial examination of
      the deceased."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, I see less than ever how you got a chance to form such an
      extraordinary and horrible opinion if you were not there, and had only
      this printed evidence," said Maitland, waving a sheet of the <i>Times</i>,
      "to go by; and <i>this</i> is dead against you. You're too clever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I made a proper and most careful examination myself, on my return to
      town, the day after the inquest," said Barton, "and I found evidence
      enough <i>for me</i>&mdash;never mind where&mdash;to put the matter beyond
      the reach of doubt. The man was <i>murdered</i>, and murdered, as I said,
      very deliberately, by some one who was not an ordinary ignorant
      scoundrel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, I don't see how you got a chance to make your examination," said
      Maitland; "the man would be buried as usual&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me. The unclaimed bodies of paupers&mdash;and there was no one to
      claim <i>his</i>&mdash;are reserved, if needed&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see&mdash;don't go on," said Maitland, turning rather pale, and falling
      back on his sofa, where he lay for a little with his eyes shut "It is all
      the fault of this most unlucky illness of mine," he said, presently. "In
      my absence, and as nobody knew where I was, there was naturally no one to
      claim the body. The kind of people who knew about him will take no trouble
      or risk in a case like that." He was silent again for a few moments; then,
      "What do <i>you</i> make out to have been tbe cause of death?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Barton slowly, "I don't much care to go into details which
      you may say I can hardly prove, and I don't want to distress you in your
      present state of health."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you speak out! Was he poisoned? Did you detect arsenic or
      anything? He had been drinking with some one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; if, in a sense, he had been poisoned, there was literally nothing
      that could be detected by the most skilled analysis. But, my dear fellow,
      there are venoms that leave <i>no</i> internal trace. If I am right&mdash;and
      I think I am&mdash;he was destroyed by one of these. He had been a great
      traveller, had he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," answered Maitland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is strange; the murderer must have been a great traveller also.
      He must have been among the Macoushi Indians of Guiana, and well
      acquainted with their arts. I know them too. I went there botanizing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't be more explicit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said; "you must take it on my word, after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland, if not convinced, was silent He had knowledge enough of Barton,
      and of his healthy and joyous nature, to be certain that his theory was no
      morbid delusion; that he had good grounds for an opinion which, as he
      said, he could no longer, prove&mdash;which was, indeed, now incapable of
      any proof. No one had seen the commission of tbe crime, and the crime was
      of such a nature, and so cunningly planned, that it could not possibly be
      otherwise brought home to the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Maitland, knowing the <i>Hit or Miss</i>, and the private room
      up-stairs with the dormer windows, where the deed must have been done, if
      done at all, was certain that there could not possibly have been any
      eye-witness of the crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall you do?" he asked, "or have you done anything in consequence
      of your discovery? Have you been to the police?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Barton; "where was the use? How can I prove anything now? It is
      not as if poison had been used, that could be detected by analysis.
      Besides, I reflected that if I was right, the less fuss made, the more
      likely was the murderer to show his hand. Supposing he had a secret motive&mdash;and
      he must have had&mdash;he will act on that motive sooner or later. The
      quieter everything is kept, the more he feels certain he is safe, the
      sooner he will move in some way or other. Then, perhaps, there may be a
      chance of detecting him; but it's an outside chance. Do you know anything
      of the dead man's past history?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, except that he was from the North, and had lived a wandering
      life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we must wait and see. But there is his daughter, left under your
      care. What do you mean to do about <i>her?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question brought Maitland back to his old perplexities, which were now
      so terribly increased and confused by what he had just been told.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was going to tell you, when you broke in with this dreadful business.
      Things were bad before; now they are awful," said Maitland. "<i>His
      daughter has disappeared!</i> That was what I was coming to: that was the
      rest of my story. It was difficult and distressing enough before I knew
      what you tell me; now&mdash;great Heavens! what am I to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on the sofa, quite overcome. Barton put his hand encouragingly
      on his shoulder, and sat so for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me all about it, old boy?" asked Barton, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very much interested, and most anxious to aid his unfortunate
      friend. His presence, somehow, was full of help and comfort. Maitland no
      longer felt alone and friendless, as he had done after his consultation of
      Bielby. Thus encouraged, he told, as clearly and fully as possible, the
      tale of the disappearance of Margaret, and of his entire failure even to
      come upon her traces or those of her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have heard nothing since your illness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing to any purpose. What do you advise me to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is only one thing certain, to my mind," said Barton. "The seafaring
      man with whom Shields was drinking on the last night of his life, and the
      gentleman in the fur travelling-coat who sent the telegram in your name
      and took away Margaret from Miss Marlett's, are in the same employment,
      or, by George, are probably the same person. Now, have you any kind of
      suspicion who they or he may be? or can you suggest any way of tracking
      him or them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Maitland; "my mind is a perfect blank on the subject. I never
      heard of the sailor till the woman at the <i>Hit or Miss</i> mentioned
      him, the night the body was found. And I never heard of a friend of
      Shields', a friend who was a gentleman, till I went down to the school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then all we can do at present is, <i>not</i> to set the police at work&mdash;they
      would only prevent the man from showing&mdash;but to find out whether
      anyone answering to the description is 'wanted' or is on their books, at
      Scotland Yard. Why are we not in Paris, where a man, whatever his social
      position might be, who was capable of that unusual form of crime, would
      certainly have his <i>dossier</i>? They order these things better in
      France."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is just one thing about him, at least about the man who was
      drinking with poor Shields on the night of his death. He was almost
      certainly tattooed with some marks or other. Indeed, I remember Mrs.
      Gullick&mdash;that's the landlady of the <i>Hit or Miss</i>&mdash;saying
      that Shields had been occupied in tattooing him. He did a good deal in
      that way for sailors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove," said Barton, "if any fellow understands tattooing, and the
      class of jail-birds who practise it, I do. It is a clew after a fashion;
      but, after all, many of them that go down to the sea in ships are
      tattooed, even when they are decent fellows; and besides, we seldom, in
      our stage of society, get a view of a fellow-creature with nothing on but
      these early decorative designs."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was only too obvious, and rather damping to Maitland, who for a
      moment had been inclined to congratulate himself on his <i>flair</i> as a
      detective.

      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;The Jaffa Oranges.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "Letting <i>I dare not</i> wait upon <i>I would</i>."
    </h3>
    <p>
      Of all fairy gifts, surely the most desirable in prospect, and the most
      embarrassing in practice, would be the magical telescope of Prince Ali, in
      the "Arabian Nights." With his glass, it will be remembered, he could see
      whatever was happening on whatever part of the earth he chose, and, though
      absent, was always able to behold the face of his beloved. How often would
      one give Aladdin's Lamp, and Fortunatus' Purse, and the invisible Cap
      which was made of "a darkness that might be <i>felt</i>" to possess for
      one hour the Telescope of Fairyland!
    </p>
    <p>
      Could Maitland and Barton have taken a peep through the tube, while they
      were pondering over the means of finding Margaret, their quest would have
      been aided, indeed, but they would scarcely have been reassured. Yet there
      was nothing very awful, nor squalid, nor alarming, as they might have
      expected, anticipated, and dreaded, in what the vision would have shown.
      Margaret was not in some foreign den of iniquity, nor, indeed, in a den at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tube enchanted would have revealed to them Margaret, not very far off,
      not in Siberia nor Teheran, but simply in Victoria Square, Pimlico, S.W.
      There, in a bedroom, not more than commonly dingy, on the drawing-room
      floor, with the rattling old green Venetian blinds drawn down, Margaret
      would have been displayed. The testimony of a cloud of witnesses, in the
      form of phials and medical vessels, proved that she had for some time been
      an invalid. The pretty dusky red of health would have been seen to have
      faded from her cheeks, and the fun and daring had died out of her eyes.
      The cheeks were white and thin, the eyes were half-closed from sickness
      and fatigue, and Margaret, a while ago so ready of speech, did not even
      bestir herself to answer the question which a gentleman, who stood almost
      like a doctor, in an attitude of respectful inquiry, was putting as to her
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall gentleman, dark, with a ripe kind of face, and full, red,
      sensitive, sensual lips, not without a trace of humor. Near the door, in a
      protesting kind of attitude, as if there against her will, was a
      remarkably handsome young person, attired plainly as a housekeeper, or
      upper-servant, The faces of some women appear to have been furnished by
      Nature, or informed by habit, with an aspect that seems to say (in fair
      members of the less educated classes), "I won't put up with none of them
      goings on." Such an expression this woman wears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you feel better, my dear?" the dark gentleman asks again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's going on well enough," interrupted the woman with the beautiful
      dissatisfied face. "What with peaches and grapes from Covent Garden, and
      tonics as you might bathe in&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She <i>ought</i> to get well," the dissatisfied woman continued, as if
      the invalid were obstinately bent on remaining ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not speaking, at the moment, to you, Mrs. Darling," said the dark
      gentleman, with mockery in his politeness, "but to the young lady whom I
      have entrusted to your charge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pretty trust!" the woman replied, with a sniff
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, as you kindly say, an extremely pretty trust. And now, Margaret, my
      dear&mdash;'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair woman walked to the window, and stared out of it with a trembling
      lip, and eyes that saw nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Margaret, my dear, tell me for yourself, how do you feel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind," answered the girl at last. "I am sure I am better. I
      am not very strong yet. I hope I shall get up soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there anything you would like? Perhaps you are tired of peaches and
      grapes; may I send you some oranges?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you; you are very good. I am often thirsty when I waken, or
      rather when I leave off dreaming. I seem to dream, rather than sleep, just
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor girl!" said the dark gentleman, in a pitying voice. "And what do you
      dream?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There seems to be a dreadful quiet, smooth, white place," said the girl,
      slowly, "where I am; and something I feel&mdash;something, I don't know
      what&mdash;drives me out of it. I cannot rest in it; and then I find
      myself on a dark plain, and a great black horror, a kind of blackness
      falling in drifts, like black snow in a wind, sweeps softly over me, till
      I feel mixed in the blackness; and there is always some one watching me,
      and chasing me in the dark&mdash;some one I can't see. Then I slide into
      the smooth, white, horrible place again, and feel I <i>must</i> get away
      from it. Oh, I don't know which is worst! And they go and come all the
      while I'm asleep, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am waiting for the doctor to look in again; but all <i>I</i> can do is
      to get you some Jaffa oranges, nice large ones, myself. You will oblige
      me, Mrs. Darling" (he turned to the housekeeper), "by placing them in Miss
      Burnside's room, and then, perhaps, she will find them refreshing when she
      wakes. Good-by for the moment, Margaret."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair woman said nothing, and the dark gentleman walked into the
      street, where a hansom cab waited for him. "Covent Garden," he cried to
      the cabman.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have not for some time seen, or rather we have for some time made
      believe not to recognize, the Hon. Thomas Cranley, whose acquaintance (a
      very compromising one) we achieved early in this narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cranley, "with his own substantial private purpose sun-clear before
      him" (as Mr. Carlyle would have said, in apologizing for some more
      celebrated villain), had enticed Margaret from school. Nor had this been,
      to a person of his experience and resources, a feat of very great
      difficulty. When he had once learned, by the simplest and readiest means,
      the nature of Maitland's telegram to Miss Marlett, his course had been
      dear. The telegram which followed Maitland's, and in which Cranley used
      Maitland's name, had entirely deceived Miss Marlett, as we have seen. By
      the most obvious ruses he had prevented Maitland from following his track
      to London. His housekeeper had entered the "engaged" carriage at
      Westbourne Park, and shared, as far as the terminus, the compartment
      previously occupied by himself and Margaret alone. Between Westbourne Park
      and Paddington he had packed the notable bearskin coat in his portmanteau.
      The consequence was, that at Paddington no one noticed a gentleman in a
      bearskin coat, travelling alone with a young lady. A gentleman in a light
      ulster, travelling with two ladies, by no means answered to the
      description Maitland gave in his examination of the porters. They,
      moreover, had paid but a divided attention to Maitland's inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of Cranley's device was secured by its elementary simplicity.
      A gentleman who, for any reason, wishes to obliterate his trail, does
      wisely to wear some very notable, conspicuous, unmistakable garb at one
      point of his progress. He then becomes, in the minds of most who see him,
      "the man in the bearskin coat," or "the man in the jack-boots," or "the
      man with the white hat." His identity is practically merged in that of the
      coat, or the boots, or the hat; and when he slips out of them, he seems to
      leave his personality behind, or to pack it up in his portmanteau, or with
      his rugs. By acting on this principle (which only requires to be stated to
      win the assent of pure reason), Mr. Cranley had successfully lost himself
      and Margaret in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Margaret his task had been less difficult than it looked. She
      recognized him as an acquaintance of her father's, and he represented to
      her that he had been an officer of the man-of-war in which her father had
      served; that he had lately encountered her father, and pitied his poverty&mdash;in
      poor Shields, an irremediable condition. The father, so he declared, had
      spoken to him often and anxiously about Margaret, and with dislike and
      distrust about Maitland. According to Mr. Cranley, Shield's chief desire
      in life had been to see Margaret entirely free from Maitland's
      guardianship. But he had been conscious that to take the girl away from
      school would be harmful to her prospects. Finally, with his latest breath,
      so Mr. Cranley declared, he had commended Margaret to his old officer, and
      had implored him to abstract her from the charge of the Fellow of St
      Gatien's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret, as we know, did not entertain a very lively kindness for
      Maitland, nor had she ever heard her father speak of that unlucky young
      man with the respect which his kindness, his academic rank, and his
      position in society deserved. It must be remembered that, concerning the
      manner of her father's death, she had shrunk from asking questions. She
      knew it had been sudden; she inferred that it had not been reputable.
      Often had she dreaded for him one of the accidents against which
      Providence does not invariably protect the drunkard. Now the accident had
      arrived, she was fain to be ignorant of the manner of it. Her new
      guardian, again, was obviously a gentleman; he treated her with perfect
      politeness and respect, and, from the evening of the day when she left
      school, she had been in the charge of that apparently correct chaperon,
      the handsome housekeeper with the disapproving countenance. Mr. Cranley
      had even given up to her his own rooms in Victoria Square, and had lodged
      elsewhere; his exact address Margaret did not know. The only really
      delicate point&mdash;Cranley's assumption of the name of "Mr. Lithgow"&mdash;he
      frankly confessed to her as soon as they were well out of the Dovecot. He
      represented that, for the fulfilment of her father's last wish, the ruse
      of the telegram and the assumed name had been necessary, though highly
      repugnant to the feelings of an officer and a gentleman. Poor Margaret had
      seen nothing of gentlemen, except as philanthropists, and (as we know)
      philanthropists permit themselves a license and discretion not customary
      in common society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, even had the girl's suspicions been awakened, her illness
      prevented her from too closely reviewing the situation. She was with her
      father's friend, an older man by far, and therefore a more acceptable
      guardian than Maitland. She was fulfilling her father's wish, and hoped
      soon to be put in the way of independence, and of earning her own
      livelihood; and independence was Margaret's ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father's friend, her own protector&mdash;in that light she regarded
      Cranley, when she was well enough to think consecutively. There could be
      no more complete hallucination. Cranley was one of those egotists who do
      undoubtedly exist, but whose existence, when they are discovered, is a
      perpetual surprise even to the selfish race of men. In him the instinct of
      self-preservation (without which the race could not have endured for a
      week) had remained absolutely unmodified, as it is modified in the rest of
      us, by thousands of years of inherited social experience. Cran-ley's
      temper, in every juncture, was precisely that of the first human being who
      ever found himself and other human beings struggling in a flood for a
      floating log that will only support one of them. Everything must give way
      to his desire; he had literally never denied himself anything that he
      dared taka As certainly as the stone, once tossed up, obeys the only law
      it knows, and falls back to earth, so surely Cranley would obtain what he
      desired (if it seemed safe), though a human life, or a human soul, stood
      between him and his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Margaret stood, at this moment, between him and the aims on which his
      greed was desperately bent. It was, therefore, necessary that she should
      vanish; and to that end he had got her into his power. Cranley's original
      idea had been the obvious one of transporting the girl to the Continent,
      where, under the pretence that a suitable situation of some kind had been
      found for her, he would so arrange that England should never see her more,
      and that her place among honest women should be lost forever. But there
      were difficulties in the way of this tempting plan. For instance, the girl
      knew some French, and was no tame, unresisting fool; and then Margaret's
      illness had occurred, and had caused delay, and given time for reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," he thought, as he lit his cigar and examined his mustache in
      the mirror (kindly provided for that purpose in well-appointed hansoms)&mdash;"after
      all it is only, the dead who tell no tales, and make no inconvenient
      claims."
    </p>
    <p>
      For after turning over in his brain the various safe and easy ways of
      "removing" an inconvenient person, one devilish scheme had flashed across
      a not uninstructed intellect&mdash;a scheme which appeared open to the
      smallest number of objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She shall take a turn for the worse," he thought; "and the doctor will be
      an uncommonly clever man, and particularly well read in criminal
      jurisprudence, if he sees anything suspicious in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus pondering, this astute miscreant stopped at Covent Garden, dismissed
      his cab, and purchased a basket of very fine Jaffa oranges. He then hailed
      another cab, and drove with his parcel to the shop of an eminent firm of
      chemists, again dismissing his cab. In the shop he asked for a certain
      substance, which it may be as well not to name, and got what he wanted in
      a small phial, marked <i>poison</i>. Mr. Cranley then called a third cab,
      gave the direction of a surgical-instrument maker's (also eminent), and
      amused his leisure during the drive in removing the label from the bottle.
      At the surgical-instrument maker's he complained of neuralgia, and
      purchased a hypodermic syringe for injecting morphine or some such anodyne
      into his arm. À fourth cab took him back to the house in Victoria Square,
      where he let himself in with a key, entered the dining-room, and locked
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was he satisfied with this precaution. After aimlessly moving chairs
      about for a few minutes, and prowling up and down the room, he paused and
      listened. What he heard induced him to stuff his pocket-handkerchief into
      the keyhole, and to lay the hearth-rug across the considerable chink
      which, as is usual, admitted a healthy draught under the bottom of the
      door. Then the Honorable Mr. Cranley drew down the blinds, and unpacked
      his various purchases. He set them out on the table in order&mdash;the
      oranges, the phial, and the hypodermic syringe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he carefully examined the oranges, chose half a dozen of the best,
      and laid the others on a large dessert plate in the dining-room cupboard.
      One orange he ate, and left the skin on a plate on the table, in company
      with a biscuit or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all this had been arranged to his mind, Mr. Cranley chose another
      orange, filled a wineglass with the liquid in the phial, and then drew off
      a quantity in the little syringe. Then he very delicately and carefully
      punctured the skin of one of the oranges, and injected into the fruit the
      contents of the syringe. This operation he elaborately completed in the
      case of each of the six chosen oranges, and then tenderly polished their
      coats with a portion of the skin of the fruit he had eaten. That portion
      of the skin he consumed to dust in the fire; and, observing that a strong
      odor remained in the room, he deliberately turned on the unlighted gas for
      a few minutes. After this he opened the window, sealed his own seal in red
      wax on paper a great many times, finally burning the collection, and lit a
      large cigar, which he smoked through with every appearance of enjoyment.
      While engaged on this portion of his task, he helped himself frequently to
      sherry from the glass, first carefully rinsed, into which he had poured
      the liquid from the now unlabelled phial. Lastly he put the phial in his
      pocket with the little syringe, stored the six oranges, wrapped in
      delicate paper, within the basket, and closed the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next he unlocked the door, and, without opening it, remarked in a sweet
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Alice, you may come in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The handle turned, and the housekeeper entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is Miss Burnside?" he asked, in the same silvery accents. (He had
      told Margaret that she had better be known by that name, for the present
      at least.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is asleep. I hope she may never waken. What do you want with her? Why
      are you keeping her in this house? What devil's brew have you been making
      that smells of gas and sherry and sealing-wax?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear girl," replied Mr. Cranley, "you put too many questions at once.
      As to your first pair of queries, my reasons for taking care of Miss
      Burnside are my own business, and do not concern you, as my housekeeper.
      As to the 'devil's brew' which you indicate in a style worthy rather of
      the ages of Faith and of Alchemy, than of an epoch of positive science,
      did you never taste sherry and sealing-wax? If you did not, that is one of
      the very few alcoholic combinations in which you have never, to my
      knowledge, attempted experiments. Is there any other matter on which I can
      enlighten an intelligent and respectful curiosity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair woman's blue eyes and white face seemed to glitter with anger,
      like a baleful lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand your chaff," she said, with a few ornamental epithets,
      which, in moments when she was deeply stirred, were apt to decorate her
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I grieve to be obscure," he answered; "<i>brevis esse laboro</i>, the old
      story. But, as you say Miss Burnside is sleeping, and as, when she wakens,
      she may be feverish, will you kindly carry these oranges and leave them on
      a plate by her bedside? They are Jaffa oranges, and finer fruit, Alice, my
      dear, I have seldom tasted! After that, go to Cavendish Square, and leave
      this note at the doctor's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing's too good for <i>her!</i>" growled the jealous woman,
      thinking of the fruit; to which he replied by offering her several of the
      oranges not used in his experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bearing these, she withdrew, throwing a spiteful glance and leaving the
      door unshut, so that her master distinctly heard her open Margaret's door,
      come out again, and finally leave the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, I'll give her a quarter of an hour to waken," said Mr. Cranley, and
      he took from his pocket a fresh copy of the <i>Times</i>. He glanced
      rather anxiously at the second column of the outer sheet "Still
      advertising for him," he said to himself; and he then turned to the
      sporting news. His calmness was extraordinary, but natural in him; for the
      reaction of terror at the possible detection of his villainy had not yet
      come on. When he had read all that interested him in the <i>Times</i>, he
      looked hastily at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just twenty minutes gone," he said. "Time she wakened&mdash;and tried
      those Jaffa oranges."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he rose, went up stairs stealthily, paused a moment opposite
      Margaret's door, and entered the drawing-room. Apparently he did not find
      any of the chairs in the dining-room comfortable enough; for he chose a
      large and heavy <i>fauteuil</i>, took it up in his arms, and began to
      carry it out In the passage, just opposite Margaret's chamber, he stumbled
      so heavily that he fell, and the weighty piece of furniture was dashed
      against the door of the sick-room, making a terrible noise. He picked it
      up, and retired silently to the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would have wakened the dead," he whispered to himself, "and she is
      not dead&mdash;yet. She is certain to see the oranges, and take one of
      them, and then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The reflection did not seem to relieve him, as he sat, gnawing his
      mustache, in the chair he had brought down with him. Now the deed was
      being accomplished, even his craven heart awoke to a kind of criminal
      remorse. Now anxiety for the issue made him wish the act undone, or
      frustrated; now he asked himself if there were no more certain and less
      perilous way. So intent was his eagerness that a strange kind of lucidity
      possessed him. He felt as if he beheld and heard what was passing in the
      chamber of sickness, which he had made a chamber of Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has wakened&mdash;she has looked round&mdash;she has seen the poisoned
      fruit&mdash;she has blessed him for his kindness in bringing it&mdash;she
      has tasted the oranges&mdash;she has turned to sleep again&mdash;and the
      unrelenting venom is at its work!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, strange forces that are about us, all inevitably acting, each in his
      hour and his place, each fulfilling his law without turning aside to the
      right hand or to the left! The rain-drop running down the pane, the star
      revolving round the sun of the furthest undiscoverable system, the grains
      of sand sliding from the grasp, the poison gnawing and burning the tissues&mdash;each
      seems to move in his inevitable path, obedient to an unrelenting will.
      Innocence, youth, beauty&mdash;that will spares them not. The rock falls
      at its hour, whoever is under it. The deadly drug slays, though it be
      blended with the holy elements. It is a will that moves all things&mdash;<i>mens
      agitat molem</i>; and yet we can make that will a slave of our own, and
      turn this way and that the blind steadfast forces, to the accomplishment
      of our desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, naturally, with these transcendental reflections that the
      intellect of Mr. Cranley was at this moment engaged. If he seemed actually
      to be present in Margaret's chamber, watching every movement and hearing
      every heart-beat of the girl he had doomed, his blue lips and livid face,
      from which he kept wiping the cold drops, did not therefore speak of late
      ruth, or the beginning of remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was entirely on his own security and chances of escaping detection that
      he was musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now it's done, it can't be undone," he said. "But is it so very safe,
      after all? The stuff is not beyond analysis, unluckily; but it's much more
      hard to detect this way, mixed with the orange-juice, than any other way.
      And then there's all the horrid fuss afterward. Even if there is not an
      inquest&mdash;as, of course, there won't be&mdash;they'll ask who the girl
      is, what the devil she was doing here. Perhaps they'll, some of them,
      recognize Alice: she has been too much before the public, confound her. It
      may not be very hard to lie through all these inquiries, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he looked mechanically at his cold fingers, and bit his
      thumb-nail, and yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By gad! I wish I had not risked it," he said to himself; and his
      complexion was now of a curious faint blue, and his heart began to flutter
      painfully in a manner not strange in his experience. He sunk back in his
      chair, with his hands all thrilling and pricking to the finger-tips. He
      took a large silver flask from his pocket, but he could scarcely unscrew
      the stopper, and had to manage it with his teeth. A long pull at the
      liquor restored him, and he began his round of reflections again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That French fellow who tried it this way in Scotland was found out," he
      said; "and&mdash;" He did not like, even in his mind, to add that the
      "French fellow, consequently, suffered the extreme penalty of the law. But
      then he was a fool, and boasted beforehand, and bungled it infernally.
      Still, it's not absolutely safe: the other plan I thought of first was
      better. By gad! I wish I could be sure she had not taken the stuff.
      Perhaps she hasn't. Anyway, she must be asleep again now; and, besides,
      there are the other oranges to be substituted for those left in the room,
      if she <i>has</i> taken it. I <i>must</i> go and see. I don't like the
      job."
    </p>
    <p>
      He filled his pockets with five unpoisoned oranges, and the skin of a
      sixth, and so crept upstairs. His situation was, perhaps, rather novel.
      With murder in his remorseless heart, he yet hoped against hope, out of
      his very poltroonery, that murder had not been done. At the girl's door he
      waited and listened, his face horribly agitated and shining wet. All was
      silent. His heart was sounding hoarsely within him, like a dry pump: he
      heard it, so noisy and so distinct that he almost feared it might wake the
      sleeper. If only, after all, she had not touched the fruit!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took the door-handle in his clammy grasp; he had to cover it with
      a handkerchief to get a firm hold. He turned discreetly, and the door was
      pushed open in perfect stillness, except for that dreadful husky thumping
      of his own heart. At this moment the postman's hard knock at the door
      nearly made him cry out aloud. Then he entered; a dreadful visitor, had
      anyone seen him. She did not see him; she was asleep, sound asleep; in the
      dirty brown twilight of a London winter day, he could make out that much.
      He did not dare draw close enough to observe her face minutely, or bend
      down and listen for her breath. And the oranges! Eagerly he looked at
      them. There were only five of them. Surely&mdash;no! a sixth had fallen on
      the floor, where it was lying. With a great sigh of relief he picked up
      all the six oranges, put them in his pockets, and, as shrinkingly as he
      had come-yet shaking his hand at the girl, and cursing his own cowardice
      under his breath&mdash;he stole down stairs, opened the dining-room door,
      and advanced into the blind, empty dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I'll settle with you!" came a voice out of the dimness; and the start
      wrought so wildly on his nerves, excited to the utmost degree as they
      were, that he gave an inarticulate cry of alarm and despair. Was he
      trapped, and by whom?
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment he saw whence the voice came. It was only Alice Darling, in
      bonnet and cloak, and with a face flushed with something more than anger,
      that stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not much used to shame, he was yet ashamed of his own alarm, and tried to
      dissemble it. He sat down at a writing-table facing her, and merely
      observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that you have returned, Alice, will you kindly bring lights? I want
      to read."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were you doing up-stairs just now?" she snarled. "Why did you send
      me off to the doctor's, out of the way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good girl, I have again and again advised you to turn that invaluable
      curiosity of yours&mdash;curiosity, a quality which Mr. Matthew Arnold so
      justly views with high esteem&mdash;into wider and nobler channels.
      Disdain the merely personal; accept the calm facts of domestic life as you
      find them; approach the broader and less irritating problems of Sociology
      (pardon the term) or Metaphysics."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was cruel to see the enjoyment he got out of teasing this woman by an
      ironical jargon which mystified her into madness. This time he went too
      far. With an inarticulate snarl of passion she lifted a knife that lay on
      the dining-room table and made for him. But this time, being prepared, he
      was not alarmed; nay, he seemed to take leasure in the success of his plan
      of tormenting. The heavy escritoire at which he sat was a breastwork
      between him and the angry woman. He coolly opened a drawer; produced a
      revolver, and remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I did not ask for the carving-knife, Alice. I asked for lights; and
      you will be good enough to bring them. I am your master, you know, in
      every sense of the word; and you are aware that you had better both hold
      your tongue and keep your hands off me&mdash;and off drink. Fetch the
      lamp!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the room cowed, like a beaten dog. She returned, set the lamp
      silently on the table, and was gone. Then he noticed a letter, which lay
      on the escritoire, and was addressed to him. It was a rather peculiar
      letter to look at, or rather the envelope was peculiar; for, though
      bordered with heavy black, it was stamped, where the seal should have
      been, with a strange device in gold and colors&mdash;a brown bun, in a
      glory of gilt rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. St John Deloraine," he said, taking it up. "How in the world did <i>she</i>
      find me out? Well, she is indeed a friend that sticketh closer than a
      brother&mdash;a deal closer than Surbiton, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Surbiton was the elder brother of Mr. Cranley, and bore the second
      title of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suppose there is another woman in London," he thought to himself,
      "that has not heard all about the row at the Cockpit, and that would write
      to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he tore the chromatic splendors of the device on the envelope, and
      read the following epistle:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Early English Bunhouse,

     "Chelsea, Friday. "My dear Mr. Cranley,

     "Where are you hiding, or yachting, you wandering man? I can
     hear nothing of you from anyone&mdash;nothing <i>good</i>, and you
     know I never believe anything <i>else</i>. Do come and see me, at
     the old Bunhouse here, and tell me about <i>yourself</i>"
</pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;("She <i>has</i> heard," he muttered)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &mdash;"and help me in a little difficulty. Our housekeeper (you
     know we are strictly <i>blue ribbon&mdash;a cordon bleu</i>, I call
     her) has become engaged to a <i>plumber</i>, and she is leaving
     us. <i>Can</i> you recommend me another? I know how interested
     you are (in spite of your wicked jokes) in our little
     enterprise. And we also want a girl, to be under the
     housekeeper, and keep the accounts. Surely you will come to
     see me, whether you can advise me or not.

     "Yours very truly,

     "Mary St. John Deloraine"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Idiot!" murmured Mr. Cranley, as he finished reading this document; and
      then he added, "By Jove! it's lucky, too. I'll put these two infernal
      women off on <i>her</i>, and Alice will soon do for the girl, if she once
      gets at the drink. She's dangerous, by Jove, when she has been drinking.
      Then the Law will do for Alice, and all will be plain sailing in smooth
      waters."

      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;Mrs. St. John Deloraine
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. John Deloraine, whose letter to Mr. Cranley we have been
      privileged to read, was no ordinary widow. As parts of her character and
      aspects of her conduct were not devoid of the kind of absurdity which is
      caused by virtues out of place, let it be said that a better, or kinder,
      or gentler, or merrier soul than that of Mrs. St. John Deloraine has
      seldom inhabited a very pleasing and pretty tenement of clay, and a house
      in Cheyne Walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maiden name of this lady was by no means so euphonious as that which
      she had attained by marriage. Miss Widdicombe, of Chipping Carby, in the
      county of Somerset, was a very lively, good-hearted and agreeable young
      woman; but she was by no means favorably looked on by the ladies of the
      County Families. Now, in the district around Chipping Carby, the County
      Families are very County indeed, few more so. There is in their demeanor a
      kind of <i>morgue</i> so funereal and mournful, that it inevitably reminds
      the observer (who is not County) of an edifice in Paris, designed by
      Méryon, and celebrated by Mr. Robert Browning. The County Families near
      Chipping Carby are far, far from gay, and what pleasure they do take, they
      take entirely in the society of their equals. So determined are they to
      drink delight of tennis with their peers, and with nobody else, that even
      the Clergy are excluded, <i>ex officio</i>, and in their degrading
      capacity of ministers of Religion, from the County Lawn Tennis Club. As we
      all know how essential young curates fresh from college are to the very
      being of rural lawn-tennis, no finer proof can be given of the
      inaccessibility of the County people around Chipping Carby, and of the
      sacrifices which they are prepared to make to their position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, born in the very purple, and indubitably (despite his profession) one
      of the gentlest born of men, was, some seven years ago, a certain Mr. St.
      John Deloraine. He held the sacrosanct position of a squarson, being at
      once Squire and Parson of the parish of Little Wentley. At the head of the
      quaint old village street stands, mirrored in a moat, girdled by beautiful
      gardens, and shadowy with trees, the Manor House and Parsonage (for it is
      both in one) of Wentley Deloraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this desirable home and opulent share of earth's good things did Mr.
      St. John Deloraine succeed in boyhood. He went to Oxford, he travelled a
      good deal, he was held in great favor and affection by the County matrons
      and the long-nosed young ladies of the County. Another, dwelling on such
      heights as he, might have become haughty; but there was in this young man
      a cheery naturalness and love of mirth which often drove him from the
      society of his equals, and took him into that of attorneys' daughters.
      Fate drew him one day to an archery meeting at Chipping Carby, and there
      he beheld Miss Widdicombe. With her he paced the level turf, her "points"
      he counted, and he found that she, at least, could appreciate his somewhat
      apt quotation from <i>Chastelard</i>:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Pray heaven, we make good Ends."
</pre>
    <p>
      Miss Widdicombe <i>did</i> make good "Ends." She vanquished Mrs.
      Struggles, the veteran lady champion of the shaft and bow, a sportswoman
      who was now on the verge of sixty. Why are ladies, who, almost
      professionally, "rejoice in arrows," like the Homeric Artemis&mdash;why
      are they nearly always so well stricken in years? Was Maid Marion forty at
      least before her performances obtained for her a place in the well-known
      band of Hood, Tuck, Little John, and Co.?
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, is a digression. For our purpose it is enough that the
      contrast between Miss Widdicombe's vivacity and the deadly stolidity of
      the County families, between her youth and the maturity of her vanquished
      competitors, entirely won the heart of Mr. St John Deloraine. He saw&mdash;he
      loved her&mdash;he was laughed at&mdash;he proposed&mdash;he was accepted&mdash;and,
      oh, shame! the County had to accept, more or less, Miss Widdicombe, the
      attorney's daughter, as <i>châtelaine</i> (delightful word, and dear to
      the author of <i>Guy Livingstone</i>) of Wentley Deloraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the early death of her husband threw Mrs. St John Deloraine almost
      alone on the world (for her family had, naturally, been offended by her
      good fortune), she left the gray old squarsonage, and went to town. In
      London, Mrs. St John Deloraine did not find people stiff, With a good
      name, an impulsive manner, a kind heart, a gentle tongue, and plenty of
      money, she was welcome almost everywhere, except at the big County dinners
      which the County people of her district give to each other when they come
      to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lady, like many of us, had turned to charity and philanthropy in the
      earlier days of her bereavement; but, unlike most of us, her benevolence
      had not died out with the sharpest pangs of her sorrow. Never, surely, was
      there such a festive philanthropist as Mrs. St. John Deloraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would go from a garden-party to a mothers' meeting; she was great at
      taking children for a day in the country, and had the art of keeping them
      amused. She was on a dozen charitable committees, belonged to at least
      three clubs, at which gentlemen as well as ladies of fashion were
      eligible, and where music and minstrelsy enlivened the after-dinner hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      So good and unsuspecting, unluckily, was Mrs. St. John Deloraine, that she
      made bosom friends for life, and contracted vows of eternal sympathy,
      wherever she went. At Aix, or on the Spanish frontier, she has been seen
      enjoying herself with acquaintances a little dubious, like Greek texts
      which, if not absolutely corrupt, yet stand greatly in need of
      explanation. It is needless to say that gentlemen of fortune, in the old
      sense&mdash;that is, gentlemen in quest of a fortune&mdash;pursued hotly
      or artfully after Mrs. St. John Deloraine. But as she never for a moment
      suspected their wiles, so these devices were entirely wasted on her, and
      her least warrantable admirers found that she insisted on accepting them
      as endowed with all the Christian virtues. Just as some amateurs of music
      are incapable of conceiving that there breathes a man who has no joy in
      popular concerts (we shall have popular conic sections next), so Mrs. St
      John Deloraine persevered in crediting all she met with a passion for
      virtue. Their speech might bewray them as worldlings of the world, but she
      insisted on interpreting their talk as a kind of harmless levity, as a
      mere cynical mask assumed by a tender and pious nature. Thus, no one ever
      combined a delight in good works with a taste for good things so
      successfully as Mrs. St John Deloraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the lady's "favorite vanity," in the matter of good works,
      was <i>The Bunhouse</i>. This really serviceable, though quaint,
      institution was not, in idea, quite unlike Maitland's enterprise of the
      philanthropic public-house, the <i>Hit or Miss</i>. In a slum of Chelsea
      there might have been observed a modest place of entertainment, in the
      coffee and bun line, with a highly elaborate Chelsea Bun painted on the
      sign. This piece of art, which gave its name to the establishment, was the
      work of one of Mrs. St John Deloraine's friends, an artist of the highest
      promise, who fell an early victim to arrangements in haschisch and Irish
      whiskey. In spite of this ill-omened beginning, <i>The Bunhouse</i> did
      very useful work. It was a kind of unofficial club and home, not for
      Friendly Girls, nor the comparatively subdued and domesticated slavery of
      common life, but for the tameless tribes of young women of the metropolis.
      Those who disdain service, who turn up expressive features at sewing
      machines, and who decline to stand perpendicularly for fifteen hours a day
      in shops&mdash;all these young female outlaws, not professionally vicious,
      found in <i>The Bunhouse</i> a kind of charitable shelter and home.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were amused, they were looked after, they were encouraged not to
      stand each other drinks, nor to rival the profanity of their brothers and
      fathers. "Places" were found for them, in the rare instances when they
      condescended to "places." Sometimes they breakfasted at <i>The Bunhouse</i>,
      sometimes went there to supper. Very often they came in a state of
      artificial cheerfulness, or ready for battle. Then there would arise such
      a disturbance as civilization seldom sees. Not otherwise than when boys,
      having tied two cats by the tails, hang them over the handle of a door&mdash;they
      then spit, and shriek, and swear, fur flies, and the clamor goes up to
      heaven: so did the street resound when the young patrons of <i>The
      Bunhouse</i> were in a warlike humor. Then the stern housekeeper would
      intervene, and check these motions of their minds, <i>haec certamina tanta</i>,
      turning the more persistent combatants into the street. Next day Mrs. St.
      John Deloraine would come in her carriage, and try to be very severe, and
      then would weep a little, and all the girls would shed tears, all would
      have a good cry together, and finally the Lady Mother (Mrs. St John
      Deloraine) would take a few of them for a drive in the Park. After that
      there would be peace for a while, and presently disturbances would come
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this establishment it was that Mrs. St. John Deloraine wanted a
      housekeeper and an assistant. The former housekeeper, as we have been
      told, had yielded to love, "which subdues the hearts of all female women,
      even of the prudent," according to Homer, and was going to share the home
      and bear the children of a plumber. With her usual invincible innocence,
      Mrs. St. John Deloraine had chosen to regard the Hon. Thomas Cranley as a
      kind good Christian in disguise, and to him she appealed in her need of a
      housekeeper and assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      No application could possibly have suited that gentleman better. <i>He</i>
      could give his own servant an excellent character; and if once she was
      left to herself, to her passions, and the society of Margaret, that young
      lady's earthly existence would shortly cease to embarrass Mr. Cranley.
      Probably there was not one other man among the motley herds of Mrs. St.
      John Deloraine's acquaintance who would have used her unsuspicious
      kindness as an instrument in a plot of any sort. But Mr. Cranley had (when
      there was no personal danger to be run) the courage of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I go and lunch with her?" he asked himself, as he twisted her note,
      with its characteristic black border and device of brown, and gold. "I
      haven't shown anywhere I was likely to meet anyone I knew, not since&mdash;since
      I came back from Monte Carlo."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even to himself he did not like to mention that affair of the Cockpit The
      man in the story who boasted that he had committed every crime in the
      calendar withdrew his large words when asked "if he had ever cheated at
      cards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," Mr. Cranley went on, "I don't know: I dare say it's safe enough.
      She does know some of those Cockpit fellows; confound her, she knows all
      sorts of fellows. But none of them are likely to be up so early in the day&mdash;not
      up to luncheon anyhow. She says"&mdash;and he looked again at the note&mdash;"that
      she'll be alone; but she won't. Everyone she sees before lunch she asks to
      luncheon: everyone she meets before dinner she asks to dinner. I wish I
      had her money: it would be simpler and safer by a very long way than this
      kind of business. There really seems no end to it when once you begin.
      However, here goes," said Mr. Cranley, sitting down to write a letter at
      the escritoire which had just served him as a bulwark and breastwork.
      "I'll write and accept Probably she'll have no one with her, but some girl
      from Chipping Carby, or some missionary from the Solomon Islands who never
      heard of a heathen like me."
    </p>
    <p>
      As a consequence of these reflections, Mr. Cranley arrived, when the clock
      was pointing to half-past one, at Mrs. St. John Deloraine's house in
      Cheyne Walk. He had scarcely entered the drawing-room before that lady, in
      a costume which agreeably became her pleasant English style of beauty,
      rushed into the room, tumbling over a favorite Dandie Dinmont terrier, and
      holding out both her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrier howled, and Mrs. St. John Deloraine had scarcely grasped the
      hand which Mr. Cranley extended with enthusiasm, when she knelt on the
      carpet and was consoling the Dandie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love in which thy hound has part," quoted Mr. Cranley. And the lady,
      rising with her face becomingly flushed beneath her fuzzy brown hair,
      smiled, and did not remark the sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Cranley," she said; "and, as I have put
      off luncheon till two, <i>do</i> tell me that you know someone who will
      suit me for my dear <i>Bun-house</i>. I know how much you have always been
      interested in our little project."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cranley assured her that, by a remarkable coincidence, he knew the
      very kind of people she wanted. Alice he briefly described as a
      respectable woman of great strength of character, "of body, too, I
      believe, which will not make her less fit for the position."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Mrs. St. John Deloraine, sadly; "the dear girls are sometimes a
      little tiresome. On Wednesday, Mrs. Carter, the housekeeper, you know,
      went to one of the exhibitions with her <i>fiancé</i>, and the girls broke
      all the windows and almost all the tea-things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The woman whom I am happy to be able to recommend to you will not stand
      anything of that kind," answered Mr. Cranley. "She is quiet, but extremely
      firm, and has been accustomed to deal with a very desperate character. At
      one time, I mean, she was engaged as the attendant of a person of
      treacherous and ungovernable disposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was true enough; and Mr. Cranley then began to give a more or less
      fanciful history of Margaret She had been left in his charge by her
      father, an early acquaintance, a man who had known better days, but had
      bequeathed her nothing, save an excellent schooling and the desire to earn
      her own livelihood.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, he knew he was safe enough; for Margaret was the last girl to tell
      the real tale of her life, and her desire to avoid Maitland was strong
      enough to keep her silent, even had she not been naturally proud and
      indisposed to make confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is only one thing I must ask," said Mr. Cranley, when he had quite
      persuaded the lady that Margaret would set a splendid example to her young
      friends. "How soon does your housekeeper leave you, and when do you need
      the services of the new-comers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the plumber is rather in a hurry. He really is a good man, and I
      like him better for it, though it seems rather selfish of him to want to
      rob me of Joan. He is; determined to be married before next Bank Holiday&mdash;in
      a fortnight that is&mdash;and then they will go on their honeymoon of
      three days to Yarmouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cranley blessed the luck that had not made the plumber a yet more
      impetuous wooer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No laggard in love," he said, smiling. "Well, in a fortnight the two
      women will be quite ready for their new place. But I must ask you to
      remember that the younger is somewhat delicate, and has by no means
      recovered from the shock of her father's sudden death&mdash;a very sad
      affair," added Mr. Cranley, in a sympathetic voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor dear girl!" cried Mrs. St. John Deloraine, with the ready tears in
      her eyes; for this lady spontaneously acted on the injunction to weep with
      those who weep, and also laugh with those who laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cranley, who was beginning to feel hungry, led her thoughts off to the
      latest farce in which Mr. Toole had amused the town; and when Mrs. St.
      John Deloraine had giggled till she wept again over her memories of this
      entertainment, she suddenly looked at her watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, he's very late," she said; "and yet it is not far to come from the
      <i>Hit or Miss</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the <i>Hit or Miss</i>!" cried Mr. Cranley, much louder than he was
      aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; you may well wonder, if you don't know about it, that I should have
      asked a gentleman from a public-house to meet you. But you will be quite
      in love with him; he is such a very good young man. Not handsome, nor very
      amusing; but people think a great deal too much of amusingness now. He is
      very, very good, and spends almost all his time among the poor. He is a
      Fellow of his College at Oxford."
    </p>
    <p>
      During this discourse Mr. Cranley was pretending to play with the terrier;
      but, stoop as he might, his face was livid, and he knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I tell you his name?" Mrs. St. John Deloraine ran on. "He is a&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the door was opened, and the servant announced "Mr. Maitland."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. St. John Deloraine had welcomed her new guest, she turned, and
      found that Mr. Cranley was looking out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      His position was indeed agonizing, and, in the circumstances, a stronger
      heart might have blanched at the encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cranley last met Maitland, he had been the guest of that
      philanthropist, and he had gone from his table to swindle his
      fellow-revellers. What other things he had done&mdash;things in which
      Maitland was concerned&mdash;the reader knows, or at least suspects. But
      it was not these deeds which troubled Mr. Cranley, for these he knew were
      undetected. It was that affair of the baccarat which unmanned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for it but to face Maitland and the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me introduce you&mdash;" said Mrs. St. John Deloraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need," interrupted Maitland. "Mr. Cranley and I have known
      each other for some time. I don't think we have met," he added, looking at
      Cranley, "since you dined with me at the Olympic, and we are not likely to
      meet again, I'm afraid; for to-morrow, as I have come to tell Mrs. Si John
      Deloraine, I go to Paris on business of importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cranley breathed again; it was obvious that Maitland, living out of
      the world as he did, and concerned (as Cranley well knew him to be) with
      private affairs of an urgent character, had never been told of the trouble
      at the Cockpit, or had, in his absent fashion, never attended to what he
      might have heard with the hearing of the ear. As to Paris, he had the best
      reason for guessing why Maitland was bound thither, as he was the secret
      source of the information on which Maitland proposed to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      At luncheon&mdash;which, like the dinner described by the American guest,
      was "luscious and abundant"&mdash;Mr. Cranley was more sparkling than the
      champagne, and made even Maitland laugh. He recounted little philanthropic
      misadventures of his own&mdash;cases in which he had been humorously
      misled by the <i>Captain Wraggs</i> of this world, or beguiled by the
      authors of that polite correspondence&mdash;begging letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      When luncheon was over, and when Maitland was obliged, reluctantly, to go
      (for he liked Mrs. St. John Deloraine's company very much), Cranley, who
      had determined to see him out, shook hands in a very cordial way with the
      Fellow of St. Gatien's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when are we likely to meet again?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really don't know," said Maitland. "I have business in Paris, and I
      cannot say how long I may be detained on the Continent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more can I," said Mr. Cranley to himself; "but I hope you won't return
      in time to bother me with your blundering inquiries, if ever you have the
      luck to return at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      But while he said this to himself, to Maitland he only wished a good
      voyage, and particularly recommended to him a comedy (and a <i>comédienne</i>)
      at the Palais Royal.

      CHAPTER X.&mdash;Traps.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day before the encounter with Mr. Cranley at the house of the lady of
      <i>The Bunhouse</i>, Barton, when he came home from a round of
      professional visits, had found Maitland waiting in his chill, unlighted
      lodgings. Of late, Maitland had got into the habit of loitering there,
      discussing and discussing all the mysteries which made him feel that he
      was indeed "moving about in worlds not realized." Keen as was the interest
      which Barton took in the labyrinth of his friend's affairs, he now and
      again wearied of Maitland, and of a conversation that ever revolved round
      the same fixed but otherwise uncertain points.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo, Maitland; glad to see you," he observed, with some shade of
      hypocrisy. "Anything new to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Maitland; "I really do think I have a clew at last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, wait a bit till they bring the candles," said Barton, groaning as
      the bell-rope came away in his hands. "Bring lights, please, and tea, and
      stir up the fire, Jemima, my friend," he remarked, when the blackened but
      alert face of the little slavey appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Dr. Barton, in a minute, sir," answered Jemima, who greatly admired
      the Doctor, and in ten minutes the dismal lodgings looked almost
      comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now for your clew, old man," exclaimed Barton, as he handed Maitland a
      cup of his peculiar mixture, very weak, with plenty of milk and no sugar.
      "Oh, Ariadne, what a boon that clew of yours has been to the detective
      mind! To think that, without the Minotaur, the police would probably never
      have hit on that invaluable expression, 'the police have a clew.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland thought this was trifling with the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This advertisement," he said, gravely, "appears to me undoubtedly to
      refer to the miscreant who carried off Margaret, poor girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it, by Jove?" cried Barton, with some eagerness this time. "Let's
      have a look at it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was what he read aloud:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Bearskin Coat.&mdash;The gentleman travelling with a young lady,
     who, on Feb. 19th, left a bearskin coat at the Hôtel Alsace
     and Lorraine, Avenue de l'Opéra, Paris, is requested to
     remove it, or it will be sold to defray expenses.

     "Dupin."
</pre>
    <p>
      "This <i>may</i> mean business," he said, "or it may not. In the first
      place, is there such an hotel in Paris as the 'Alsace et Lorraine,' and is
      M. Dupin the proprietor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>That's</i> all right," said Maitland. "I went at once to the Club, and
      looked up the <i>Bottin</i>, the Paris Directory, don't you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far, so good; and yet I don't quite see what you can make of it. It
      does not come to much, you know, even if the owner of the coat is the man
      you want And again, is he likely to have left such a very notable article
      of dress behind him in an hotel? Anyway, can't you send some detective
      fellow? Are you going over yourself in this awful weather?"
    </p>
    <p>
      So Barton argued, but Maitland was not to be easily put off the hopeful
      scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, don't you see," he exclaimed, "the people at the hotel will at least
      be able to give one a fuller description of the man than anything we have
      yet. And they may have some idea of where he has gone to; and, at least,
      they will have noticed how he was treating Margaret, and that, of course,
      is what I am most anxious to learn. Again, he may have left other things
      besides the coat, or there may be documents in the pockets. I have read of
      such things happening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, in 'Le Crime de l'Opéra;' and a very good story, too," answered the
      incredulous Barton; "but I don't fancy that the villain of real life is
      quite so innocent and careless as the monster of fiction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everyone knows that murderers are generally detected through some
      incredible piece of carelessness," said Mait-land; "and why should this
      elaborate scoundrel be more fortunate than the rest? If he <i>did</i>
      leave the coat, he will scarcely care to go back for it; and I do not
      think the chance should be lost, even if it is a poor one. Besides, I'm
      doing no good here, and I can do no harm there."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was undeniably true; and though Barton muttered something about "a
      false scent," he no longer attempted to turn Maitland from his purpose. He
      did, however, with some difficulty, prevent the Fellow of St. Gatien's
      from purchasing a blonde beard, one of those wigs which simulate baldness,
      and a pair of blue spectacles. In these disguises, Maitland argued, he
      would certainly avoid recognition, and so discomfit any mischief planned
      by the enemies of Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but, on the other hand, you would look exactly like a German
      professor, and probably be taken for a spy of Bismarck's," said Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Maitland reluctantly gave up the idea of disguise. He retained,
      however, certain astute notions of his own about his plan of operations,
      and these, unfortunately, he did not communicate to his friend. The fact
      is, that the long dormant romance of Maitland's character was now
      thoroughly awake, and he began, unconsciously, to enjoy the adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      His enjoyment did not last very long. The usual troubles of a winter
      voyage, acting on a dilapidated digestive system, were not spared the
      guardian of Margaret But everything&mdash;-even a period of waiting at the
      Paris <i>salle d'attente</i>, and a struggle with the <i>cochers</i> at
      the station (who, for some reason, always decline to take a fare)&mdash;must
      come to an end at last. About dinner-time, Maitland was jolted through the
      glare of the Parisian streets, to the Avenue de l'Opéra. At the Hôtel
      Alsace et Lorraine he determined not to betray himself by too precipitate
      eagerness. In the first place, he wrote an assumed name in the hotel book,
      choosing, by an unlucky inspiration, the pseudonym of Buchanan. He then
      ordered dinner in the hotel, and, by way of propitiation, it was a much
      better dinner than usual that Maitland ordered. Bottles of the higher
      Bordeaux wines, reposing in beautiful baskets, were brought at his
      command; for he was determined favorably to impress the people of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      His conduct in this matter was partly determined by the fact that, for the
      moment, the English were not popular in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, as the French newspapers declared, with more truth than they
      suspected, "Paris was not the place for English people, especially for
      English women."
    </p>
    <p>
      In these international circumstances, then, Maitland believed he showed
      the wisdom of the serpent when he ordered dinner in the fearless old
      fashion attributed by tradition to the Milords of the past But he had
      reckoned without his appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      A consequence of sea-travel, neither uncommon nor alarming, is the putting
      away of all desire to eat and drink. As the waiter carried off the
      untouched <i>hors d'oeuvres</i> (whereof Maitland only nibbled the
      delicious bread and butter); as he bore away the <i>huîtres</i>,
      undiminished in number; as the <i>bisque</i> proved too much for the guest
      of the evening; as he faltered over the soles, and failed to appreciate
      the cutlets; as he turned from the noblest <i>crûs</i> (including the
      widow's <i>crûs</i>, those of La Veuve Cliquot), and asked for <i>siphon</i>
      and <i>fine champagne</i>, the waiter's countenance assumed an air of
      owl-like sagacity. There was something wrong, the <i>garçon</i> felt sure,
      about a man who could order a dinner like Maitland's, and then decline to
      partake thereof. However, even in a republican country, you can hardly
      arrest a man merely because his intentions are better than his appetite.
      The waiter, therefore, contented himself with assuming an imposing
      attitude, and whispering something to the hall porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fellow of St. Gatien's, having dined with the Barmecide regardless of
      expense, went on (as he hoped) to ingratiate himself with the <i>concierge</i>.
      From that official he purchased two large cigars, which he did not dream
      of attempting to enjoy; and he then endeavored to enter into conversation,
      selecting for a topic the state of the contemporary drama. What would
      monsieur advise him to go to see? Where was Mile. Jane Hading playing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Having in this conversation broken the ice (and almost every rule of
      French grammar), Maitland began to lead up craftily to the great matter&mdash;the
      affair of the bearskin coat. Did many English use the hotel? Had any of
      his countrymen been there lately? He remembered that when he left England
      a friend of his had asked him to inquire about an article of dress&mdash;a
      great-coat&mdash;which he had left somewhere, perhaps in a cab. Could
      monsieur the Porter tell him where he ought to apply for news about the
      garment, a coat in <i>peau d'ours</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      On the mention of this raiment a clerkly-looking man, who had been
      loitering in the office of the <i>concierge</i>, moved to the neighborhood
      of the door, where he occupied himself in study of a railway map hanging
      on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter now was all smiles. But, certainly! Monsieur had fallen well in
      coming to him. Monsieur wanted a lost coat in skin of the bear? It had
      been lost by a compatriot of monsieur's? Would monsieur give himself the
      trouble to follow the porter to the room where lost baggage was kept?
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland, full of excitement, and of belief that he now really was on the
      trail, followed the porter, and the clerkly man (rather a liberty, thought
      Maitland) followed <i>him</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter led them to a door marked "private," and they all three
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerkly-looking person now courteously motioned Maitland to take a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman sat down in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where," he asked, "was the bearskin coat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would monsieur first deign to answer a few inquiries? Was the coat his
      own, or a friend's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A friend's," said Maitland, and then, beginning to hesitate, admitted
      that the garment only belonged to "a man he knew something about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is his name?" asked the clerkly man, who was taking notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His name, indeed! If Maitland only knew that! His French now began to grow
      worse and worse in proportion to his flurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he explained, it was very unlucky, but he did not exactly remember
      the man's name. It was quite a common name. He had met him for the first
      time on board the steamer; but the man was going to Brussels, and, finding
      that Maitland was on his way to Paris, had asked him to make inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the clerkly person, laying down his notes, asked if English gentlemen
      usually spoke of persons whom they had just met for the first time on
      board the steamer as their friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland, at this, lost his temper, and observed that, as they seemed
      disposed to give him more trouble than information, he would go and see
      the play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon the clerkly person requested monsieur to remember, in his
      deportment, what was due to Justice; and when Maitland rose, in a stately
      way, to leave the room, he also rose and stood in front of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      However little of human nature an Englishman may possess, he is rarely
      unmoved by this kind of treatment. Maitland took the man by the collar, <i>sans
      phrase</i>, and spun him round, amid the horrified clamor of the porter.
      But the man, without any passion, merely produced and displayed a card,
      containing a voucher that he belonged to the Secret Police, and calmly
      asked Maitland for "his papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland had no papers. He had understood that passports were no longer
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective assured him that passports "spoil nothing." Had monsieur
      nothing stating his identity? Maitland, entirely forgetting that he had
      artfully entered his name as "Buchanan" on the hotel book, produced his
      card, on the lower corner of which was printed, <i>St. Gatien's College.</i>
      This address puzzled the detective a good deal, while the change of name
      did not allay his suspicions, and he ended by requesting Maitland to
      accompany him into the presence of Justice. As there was no choice,
      Maitland obtained leave to put some linen in his travelling-bag, and was
      carried off to what we should call the nearest police-station. Here he was
      received in a chill bleak room by a formal man, wearing a decoration, who
      (after some private talk with the detective) asked Maitland to explain his
      whole conduct in the matter of the coat. In the first place, the
      detective's notes on their conversation were read aloud, and it was shown
      that Maitland had given a false name; had originally spoken of the object
      of his quest as "the coat of a friend;" then as "the coat of a man whom he
      knew something about;" then as "the coat of a man whose name he did not
      know;" and that, finally, he had attempted to go away without offering any
      satisfactory account of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this the philanthropist was constrained to admit; but he was, not
      unnaturally, quite unable to submit any explanation of his proceedings.
      What chiefly discomfited him was the fact that his proceedings were a
      matter of interest and observation. Why, he kept wondering, was all this
      fuss made about a coat which had, or had not, been left by a traveller at
      the hotel? It was perfectly plain that the hotel was used as a <i>souricière</i>,
      as the police say, as a trap in which all inquirers after the coat could
      be captured. Now, if he had been given time (and a French dictionary),
      Maitland might have set before the Commissaire of Police the whole story
      of his troubles. He might have begun with the discovery of Shields' body
      in the snow; he might have gone on to Margaret's disappearance (<i>enlèvement</i>),
      and to a description of the costume (bearskin coat and all) of the villain
      who had carried her away. Then he might have described his relations with
      Margaret, the necessity of finding her, the clew offered by the
      advertisement in the <i>Times</i>, and his own too subtle and ingenious
      attempt to follow up that clew. But it is improbable that this narrative,
      had Maitland told it ever so movingly, would have entirely satisfied the
      suspicions of the Commissaire of Police. It might even have prejudiced
      that official against Maitland. Moreover, the Fellow of St. Gatien's had
      neither the presence of mind nor the linguistic resources necessary to
      relate the whole plot and substance of this narrative, at a moment's
      notice, in a cold police-office, to a sceptical alien. He therefore fell
      back on a demand to be allowed to communicate with the English Ambassador;
      and that night Maitland of Gatien's passed, for the first time during his
      blameless career, in a police-cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      It were superfluous to set down in detail all the humiliations endured by
      Maitland. Do not the newspapers continually ring with the laments of the
      British citizen who has fallen into the hands of Continental Justice? Are
      not our countrymen the common butts of German, French, Spanish, and even
      Greek and Portuguese Jacks in office? When an Englishman appears, do not
      the foreign police usually arrest him at a venture, and inquire afterward?
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland had, with the best intentions, done a good deal more than most of
      these innocents to deserve incarceration. His conduct, as the Juge
      d'Instruction told him, without mincing matters, was undeniably <i>louche</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, the suspicions of M. Dupin, of the Hôtel Alsace et
      Lorraine, had been very naturally excited by seeing the advertisement
      about the great-coat in the <i>Times</i>, for he made a study of "the
      journal of the City."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a notice purporting to be signed by himself, and referring to a
      bearskin coat, said (quite untruly) to have been left in his own hotel. A
      bearskin coat! The very words breathe of Nihilism, dynamite, stratagems,
      and spoils. Then the advertisement was in English, which is, at present
      and till further notice, the language spoken by the brave Irish. M. Dupin,
      as a Liberal, had every sympathy with the brave Irish in their noble
      struggle for whatever they <i>are</i> struggling for; but he did not wish
      his hostelry to become, so to speak, the mountain-cave of Freedom, and the
      great secret storehouse of nitro-glycerine. With a view to elucidating the
      mystery of the advertisement, he had introduced the police on his
      premises, and the police had hardly settled down in its <i>affût</i>,
      when, lo! a stranger had been captured, in most suspicious circumstances.
      M. Dupin felt very clever indeed, and his friends envied him the
      distinction and advertisement which were soon to be his.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Maitland appeared, as he did in due course, before the Juge
      d'Instruction, he attempted to fall back on the obsolete <i>Civis Romanus
      sum!</i> He was an English citizen. He had written to the English
      ambassador, or rather to an old St. Gatien's man, an <i>attaché</i> of the
      embassy, whom he luckily happened to know. But this great ally chanced to
      be out of town, and his name availed Maitland nothing in his interview
      with the Juge d'Instruction. That magistrate, sitting with his back to the
      light, gazed at Maitland with steady, small gray eyes, while the scribble
      of the pen of the <i>greffier</i>, as he took down the Englishman's
      deposition, sounded shrill in the bleak torture-chamber of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your name?" asked the Juge d'Instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maitland," replied the Fellow of St. Gatien's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie!" said the Juge d'Instruction. "You entered the name of Buchanan
      in the book of the hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is on my cards, and on that letter," said Maitland, keeping his
      temper wonderfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The documents in question lay on a table, as <i>pièces justificatives</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These cards, that letter, you have robbed them from some unfortunate
      person, and have draped (<i>afflublé</i>) yourself in the trappings of
      your victim! Where is his body?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the working hypothesis which the Juge d'Instruction had formed
      within himself to account for the general conduct and proceedings of the
      person under examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is <i>whose</i> body?" asked Maitland, in unspeakable surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buchanan," said the Juge d'Instruction. (And to hear the gallantry with
      which he attacked this difficult name, of itself insured respect.)
      "Buchanan, you are acting on a deplorable system. Justice is not deceived
      by your falsehoods, nor eluded by your subterfuges. She is calm, stern,
      but merciful. Unbosom yourself freely" (<i>répandez franchement</i>), "and
      you may learn that justice can be lenient It is your interest to be
      frank." (<i>Il est de votre intérêt d'être franc</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what do you want me to say?" asked the prévenu, "What is all this
      pother about a great-coat?" (<i>Tant de fracas pour un paletot?</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland was rather proud of this sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the part of Justice to ask questions, not to answer them," said the
      Juge d'Instruction. "Levity will avail you nothing. Tell me, Buchanan, why
      did you ask for the coat at the Hôtel Alsace et Lorraine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In answer to that advertisement in the Times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is false; you yourself inserted the advertisement. But, on your own
      system, bad as it is, what did you want with the coat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It belonged to a man who had done me an ill-turn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know his name; that is just what I wanted to find out I might
      have found his tailor's name on the coat, and then have discovered for
      whom the coat was made."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are aware that the proprietor of the hotel did not insert the forged
      advertisement?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You doubt his word? You insult France in one of her citizens!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland apologized.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then whom do you suspect of inserting the advertisement, as you deny
      having done it yourself, for some purpose which does not appear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe the owner of the coat put in the advertisement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is absurd. What had he to gain by it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To remove me from London, where he is probably conspiring against me at
      this moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buchanan, you trifle with Justice!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have told you that my name is not Buchanan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why did you forge that name in the hotel book?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wrote it in the hurry and excitement of the moment; it was incorrect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you lie?" (<i>Pourquoi avez vous menti?</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland made an irritable movement
    </p>
    <p>
      "You threaten Justice. Your attitude is deplorable. You are consigned <i>au
      secret</i>, and will have an opportunity of revising your situation, and
      replying more fully to the inquiries of Justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended Maitland's first and, happily, sole interview with a Juge
      d'Instruction. Lord Walter Brixton, his old St Gatien's pupil, returned
      from the country on the very day of Maitland's examination. An interview
      (during which Lord Walter laughed unfeelingly) with his old coach was not
      refused to the <i>attaché</i>, and, in a few hours, after some formalities
      had been complied with, Maitland was a free man. His <i>pièces
      justificatives</i>, his letters, cards, and return ticket to Charing
      Cross, were returned to him intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Maitland determined to sacrifice the privileges of the last-named
      document.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going straight to Constantinople and the Greek Islands," he wrote to
      Barton. "Do you know, I don't like Paris. My attempt at an investigation
      has not been a success. I have endured considerable discomfort, and I fear
      my case will get into the <i>Figaro</i>, and there will be dozens of
      'social leaders' and 'descriptive headers' about me in all the penny
      papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Maitland gave his banker's address at Constantinople, relinquished
      the quest of Margaret, and for a while, as the Sagas say, "is out of the
      story."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;The Night of Adventures.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A cold March wind whistled and yelled round the twisted chimneys of the <i>Hit
      or Miss</i>. The day had been a trial to every sense. First there would
      come a long-drawn distant moan, a sigh like that of a querulous woman;
      then the sigh grew nearer and became a shriek, as if the same woman were
      working herself up into a passion; and finally a gust of rainy hail, mixed
      with dust and small stones, was dashed, like a parting insult, on the
      windows of the <i>Hit or Miss</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the shriek died away again into a wail and a moan, and so <i>da capo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Eliza, what do you do now that the pantomime season is over?" said
      Barton to Miss Gullick, who was busily dressing a doll, as she perched on
      the table in the parlor of the <i>Hit or Miss</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton occasionally looked into the public-house, partly to see that
      Maitland's investment was properly managed, partly because the place was
      near the scene of his labors; not least, perhaps, because he had still an
      unacknowledged hope that light on the mystery of Margaret would come from
      the original centre of the troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm in no hurry to take an engagement," answered the resolute Eliza,
      holding up and examining her doll. It was a fashionable doll, in a
      close-fitting tweed ulster, which covered a perfect panoply of other
      female furniture, all in the latest mode. As the child worked, she looked
      now and then at the illustrations in a journal of the fashions. "There's
      two or three managers in treaty with me," said Eliza. "There's the <i>Follies
      and Frivolities</i> down Norwood way, and the <i>Varieties</i> in the
      'Ammersmith Road. Thirty shillings a week and my dresses, that's what I
      ask for, and I'll get it too! Just now I'm taking a vacation, and making
      an honest penny with these things," and she nodded at a little basket full
      of the wardrobe of dolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you sell the dresses to the toy-shops, Eliza?" asked Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Eliza; "I am doing well with them. I'm not sure I shan't need
      to take on some extra hands, by the job, to finish my Easter orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pm glad you are successful," answered Barton. "I say, Eliza!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you mind showing me the room up-stairs where poor old Shields was
      sitting the night before he was found in the snow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It had suddenly occurred to Barton&mdash;it might have occurred to him
      before&mdash;that this room might be worth examining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We ain't using it now! Ill show you it," said Eliza, leading the way
      up-stairs, and pointing to a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton took hold of the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ladies first," he said, making way for Eliza, with a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," came the child's voice, from half-way down the stairs; "I won't come
      in! They say he walks, I've heard noises there at night."
    </p>
    <p>
      A cold stuffy smell came out of the darkness of the unused room. Barton
      struck a match, and, seeing a candle on the table, lit it The room had
      been left as it was when last it was tenanted. On the table were an empty
      bottle, two tumblers, and a little saucer stained with dry colors, blue
      and red, part of Shields' stock-in-trade. There were, besides, some very
      sharp needles of bone, of a savage make, which Barton recognized. They
      were the instruments used for tattooing in the islands of the Southern
      Seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton placed the lighted candle beside the saucer, and turned over the
      needles. Presently his eyes brightened: he chose one out, and examined it
      closely. It was astonishingly sharp, and was not of bone like the others,
      but of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton made an incision in the hard brittle wood with his knife, and
      carefully felt the point, which was slightly crusted with a dry brown
      substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so," he said aloud, as he placed the needle in a pocket
      instrument-case: "the stem of the leaf of the coucourite palm!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went down-stairs with the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see him?" asked Eliza, with wide-open eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be childish, Eliza: there's no one to see. Why is the room left all
      untidy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother dare not go in!" whispered the child. Then she asked in a low
      voice, "Did you never hear no more of that awful big Bird I saw the night
      old Shields died in the snow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Bird was a dream, Eliza. I am surprised such a clever girl as you
      should go on thinking about it," said Barton, rather sternly. "You were
      tired and ill, and you fancied it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I wasn't," said the child, solemnly. "I never say no more about it to
      mother, nor to nobody; but I did see it, ay, and heard it, too. I remember
      it at night in my bed, and I am afraid. Oh, what's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned with a scream, in answer to a scream on the other side of the
      curtained door that separated the parlor from the bar of the <i>Hit or
      Miss</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone seemed to fall against the door, which at the same moment flew
      open, as if the wind had burst it in. A girl, panting and holding her hand
      to her breast, her face deadly white and so contorted by terror as to be
      unrecognizable, flashed into the room. "Oh, come! oh, come!" she cried.
      "She's killing her!" Then the girl vanished as hurriedly as she had
      appeared. It was all over in a moment: the vivid impression of a face
      maddened by fear, and of a cry for help, that was all. In that moment
      Barton had seized his hat, and sped, as hard as he could run, after the
      girl. He found her breaking through a knot of loafers in the bar, who were
      besieging her with questions. She turned and saw Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, doctor, come!" she screamed again, and fled out into the night,
      crossing another girl who was apparently speeding on the same errand.
      Barton could just see the flying skirts of the first messenger, and hear
      her footfall ring on the pavement. Up a long street, down another, and
      then into a back slum she flew, and, lastly, under a swinging sign of the
      old-fashioned sort, and through a doorway. Barton, following, found
      himself for the first time within the portals of <i>The Old English
      Bun-house</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wide passage (the house was old) was crowded with girls, wildly
      excited, weeping, screaming, and some of them swearing. They were pressed
      so thick round a door at the end of the hall, that Barton could scarcely
      thrust his way through them, dragging one aside, shouldering another: it
      was a matter of life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, she's been at the drink, and she's killed her! she's killed her! I
      heard her fall!" one of the frightened girls was exclaiming with
      hysterical iteration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me pass!" shouted Barton; and reaching the door at last, he turned
      the handle and pushed. The door was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me room," he cried, and the patrons of <i>The Bun-house</i> yielding
      place a little, Barton took a little short run, and drove with all the
      weight of his shoulders against the door. It opened reluctantly with a
      crash, and he was hurled into the room by his own impetus, and by the
      stress of the girls behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he beheld was more like some dreadful scene of ancient tragedy than
      the spectacle of an accident or a crime of modern life.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the windy glare of a dozen gas-jets (red and shaken like the flame of
      blown torches by the rainy gusts that swept through a broken pane), Barton
      saw a girl stretched bleeding on the sanded floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of her arms made a pillow for her head; her soft dark hair,
      unfastened, half hid her, like a veil; the other arm lay loose by her
      side; her lips were white, her face was bloodless; but there was blood on
      the deep-blue folds about the bosom, and on the floor. At the further side
      of this girl&mdash;who was dead, or seemingly dead&mdash;sat, on a low
      stool, a woman, in a crouching, cat-like attitude, quite silent and still.
      The knife with which she had done the deed was dripping in her hand; the
      noise of the broken door, and of the entering throng, had not disturbed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment even Barton's rapidity of action and resolution were
      paralyzed by the terrible and strange vision that he beheld. He stared
      with all his eyes, in a mist of doubt and amazement, at a vision, dreadful
      even to one who saw death every day. Then the modern spirit awoke in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fetch a policeman," he whispered, to one of the crowding frightened troop
      of girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a copper at the door, sir; here he comes," said Susan, the young
      woman who had called Barton from the <i>Hit or Miss</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The helmet of the guardian of the peace appeared welcome above the throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still the pale woman in white sat as motionless as the stricken girl
      at her feet&mdash;as if she had not been an actor, but a figure in a <i>tableau</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Policeman," said Barton, "I give that woman in charge for an attempt at
      murder. Take her to the station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like the looks of her," whispered the policeman. "I'd better get
      her knife from her first, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be quick, whatever you do, and have the house cleared. I can't look after
      the wounded girl in this crowd."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus addressed, the policeman stole round toward the seated woman, whose
      eyes had never deigned, all this time, to stray from the body of her
      victim. Barton stealthily drew near, outflanking her on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were just within arm's reach of the murderess when she leaped with
      incredible suddenness to her feet, and stood for one moment erect and
      lovely as a statue, her fair locks lying about her shoulders. Then she
      raised her right hand; the knife flashed and dropped like lightning into
      her breast, and she, too, fell beside the body of the girl whom she had
      stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By George, she's gone!" cried the policeman. Barton pushed past him, and
      laid his hand on the woman's heart. She stirred once, was violently shaken
      with the agony of death, and so passed away, carrying into silence her
      secret and her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cranley's hopes had been, at least partially, fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink, I suppose, as usual. A rummy start!" remarked the policeman,
      sententiously; and then, while Barton was sounding and stanching the wound
      of the housekeeper's victim, and applying such styptics as he had within
      reach, the guardian of social order succeeded in clearing __The Bunhouse__
      of its patrons, in closing the door, and in sending a message (by the
      direction of the girl who had summoned Barton, and who seemed not devoid
      of sense) to Mrs. St. John Deloraine. While that lady was being expected,
      the girl, who now took a kind of subordinate lead, was employed by Barton
      in helping to carry Margaret to her own room, and in generally restoring
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the messenger arrived at Mrs. St John Delo-raine's house with
      Barton's brief note, and with his own curt statement that "murder was
      being done at <i>The Bun-house</i>," he found the Lady Superior rehearsing
      for a play. Mrs. St. John Deloraine was going to give a drawing-room
      representation of "Nitouche," and the terrible news found her in one of
      the costumes of the heroine. With a very brief explanation (variously
      misunderstood by her guests and fellow-amateurs) Mrs. St. John Deloraine
      hurried off, "just as she was," and astonished Barton (who had never seen
      her before) by arriving at <i>The Bunhouse</i> as a rather conventional
      shepherdess, in pink and gray, rouged, and with a fluffy flaxen wig. The
      versatility with which Mrs. St. John Deloraine made the best of all worlds
      occasionally let her into <i>inconsequences</i> of this description.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, if she was on pleasure bent, Mrs. St. John Deloraine had also, not
      only a kind heart, but a practical mind. In five minutes she had heard the
      tragic history, had dried her eyes, torn off her wig, and settled herself
      as nurse by the bedside of Margaret. The girl's wound, as Barton was
      happily able to assure her, was by no means really dangerous; for the
      point of the weapon had been turned, and had touched no vital part. But
      the prodigious force with which the blow had followed on a scene of
      violent reproaches and insane threats (described by one of the young
      women) had affected most perilously a constitution already weakened by
      sickness and trouble. Mrs. St. John Deloraine, assisted by the most
      responsible of <i>The Bun-house</i> girls, announced her intention to, sit
      up all night with the patient. Barton&mdash;who was moved, perhaps, as
      much by the beauty of the girl, and by the excitement of the events, as by
      professional duty&mdash;remained in attendance till nearly dawn, when the
      Lady Superior insisted that he should go home and take some rest. As the
      danger for the patient was not immediate, but lay in the chances of fever,
      Barton allowed himself to be persuaded, and, at about five in the morning,
      he let himself out of <i>The Bunhouse</i>, and made sleepily for his
      lodgings. But sleep that night was to be a stranger to him, and his share
      of adventures&mdash;which, like sorrows, never "come as single spies, but
      in battalions"&mdash;was by no means exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night, through which the first glimpse of dawn just peered, was
      extremely cold; and Barton, who had left his great-coat in the <i>Hit or
      Miss</i>, stamped his way homeward, his hands deep in his pockets, his hat
      tight on his head, and with his pipe for company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's the gray beginning, Zooks," he muttered to himself, in
      half-conscious quotation. He was as drowsy as a man can be who still steps
      along and keeps an open eye. The streets were empty, a sandy wind was
      walking them alone, and hard by the sullen river flowed on, the lamplights
      dimly reflected in the growing blue of morning. Barton was just passing
      the locked doors of the <i>Hit or Miss</i>&mdash;for he preferred to go
      homeward by the riverside&mdash;when a singular sound, or mixture of
      sounds, from behind the battered old hoarding close by, attracted his
      attention. In a moment he was as alert as if he had not passed a <i>nuit
      blanche</i>. The sound at first seemed not very unlike that which a
      traction engine, or any other monster that murders sleep, may make before
      quite getting up steam. Then there was plainly discernible a great
      whirring and flapping, as if a windmill had become deranged in its
      economy, and was laboring "without a conscience or an aim." Whir, whir,
      flap, thump, came the sounds, and then, mixed with and dominating them,
      the choking scream of a human being in agony. But, strangely enough, the
      scream appeared to be half checked and suppressed, as if the sufferer,
      whoever he might be, and whatever his torment, were striving with all his
      might to endure in silence. Barton had heard such cries in the rooms of
      the hospital. To such sounds the Question Chambers of old prisons and
      palaces must often have echoed. Barton stopped, thrilling with a
      half-superstitious dread; so moving, in that urban waste, were the accents
      of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then whir, flap, came the noise again, and again the human note was heard,
      and was followed by a groan. The time seemed infinite, though it was only
      to be reckoned by moments, or pulse-beats&mdash;the time during which the
      torturing crank revolved, and was answered by the hard-wrung exclamation
      of agony. Barton looked at the palings of the hoarding: they were a couple
      of feet higher than his head. Then he sprung up, caught the top at a place
      where the rusty-pointed nails were few and broken, and next moment, with
      torn coat and a scratch on his arm, he was within the palisade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the crepuscular light, bulks of things&mdash;big, black, formless&mdash;were
      dimly seen; but nearer the hoarding than the middle of the waste open
      ground was a spectacle that puzzled the looker-on. Great fans were
      winnowing the air, a wheel was running at prodigious speed, flaming vapors
      fled hissing forth, and the figure of a man, attached in some way to the
      revolving fans, was now lifted several feet from the ground, now dashed to
      earth again, now caught in and now torn from the teeth of the flying
      wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton did not pause long in empty speculation; he shouted, "Hold on!" or
      some other such encouragement, and ran in the direction of the sufferer.
      But, as he stumbled over dust-heaps, piles of wood, old baskets, outworn
      hats, forsaken boots, and all the rubbish of the waste land, the movement
      of the flying fans began to slacken, the wheels ran slowly down, and, with
      a great throb and creak, the whole engine ceased moving, as a heart stops
      beating. Then, just when all was over, a voice came from the crumpled mass
      of humanity in the centre of the hideous mechanism:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't come here; stop, on your peril! I am armed, and I will shoot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words were feeble, and scarcely audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton stood still. Even a brave man likes (the old Irish duelling days
      being over) at least to know <i>why</i> he is to be shot at.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter with you?" he said. "What on earth are you doing? How
      can <i>you</i> talk about shooting? Have you a whole bone in your body?"
    </p>
    <p>
      To this the only reply was another groan; then silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time there was a full measure of the light "which London takes the
      day to be," and Barton had a fair view of his partner in this dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see the crumpled form of a man, weak and distorted like a victim
      of the rack&mdash;scattered, so to speak&mdash;in a posture inconceivably
      out of drawing, among the fragments of the engine. The man's head was
      lowest, and rested on an old battered box; his middle was supported by a
      beam of the engine; one of his legs was elevated on one of the fans, the
      other hung disjointedly in the air. The man was strangely dressed in a
      close-fitting suit of cloth&mdash;something between the uniform of bicycle
      clubs and the tights affected by acrobats. Long, thin, gray locks fell
      back from a high yellow forehead: there was blood on his mouth and about
      his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton drew near and touched him: the man only groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How am I to help you out of this?" said the surgeon, carefully examining
      his patient, as he might now be called. A little close observation showed
      that the man's arms were strapped by buckles into the fans, while one of
      his legs was caught up in some elastic coils of the mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      With infinite tenderness, Barton disengaged the victim, whose stifled
      groans proved at once the extent of his sufferings and of his courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the man was free from the machine, and Barton discovered that, as
      far as a rapid investigation could show, there were no fatal injuries
      done, though a leg, an arm, and several ribs were fractured, and there
      were many contusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I must leave you here for a few minutes, while I go round to the
      police-office and get men and a stretcher," said Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man held up one appealing hand; the other was paralyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First hide all <i>this,</i>" he murmured, moving his head so as to
      indicate the fragments of his engine. They lay all confused, a heap of
      spars, cogs, wheels, fans, and what not, a puzzle to the science of
      mechanics. "Don't let them know a word about it," he said. "Say I had an
      accident&mdash;that I was sleep-walking, and fell from a window&mdash;say
      anything you like, but promise to keep my secret. In a week," he murmured
      dreamily, "it would have been complete. It is the second time I have just
      missed success and fame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not an idea what your secret may be," said Barton; "but here goes
      for the machine."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, while the wounded man watched him, with piteous and wistful eyes, he
      rapidly hid different fragments of the mechanism beneath and among the
      heaps of rubbish, which were many, and, for purposes of concealment,
      meritorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure you can find them all again?" asked the victim of misplaced
      ingenuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, all right," said Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you must get me to the street before you bring any help. If they
      find me here they will ask questions, and my secret will come out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how on earth am I to get you to the street?" Barton inquired, very
      naturally. "Even if you could bear being carried, I could not lift you
      over the boarding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can bear anything&mdash;I will bear anything," said the man. "Look in
      my breast, and you will find a key of a door in the palings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton looked as directed, and, fastened round the neck of the sufferer by
      a leather shoe-tie, he discovered, sure enough, a kind of skeleton-key in
      strong wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With that you can open the gate, and get me into the street," said the
      crushed man; "but be very careful not to open the door while anyone is
      passing."
    </p>
    <p>
      He only got out these messages very slowly, and after intervals of silence
      broken by groans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait! one thing more," he said, as Barton stooped to take him in his
      arms. "I may faint from pain. My address is, Paterson's Kents, hard by; my
      name is Winter." Then, after a pause, "I can pay for a private room at the
      infirmary, and I must have one. Lift the third plank from the end in the
      left-hand corner by the window, and you will find enough. Now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Barton very carefully picked up the poor man, mere bag of bones (and
      broken bones) as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horrible pain that the man endured Barton could imagine, yet he dared
      not hurry, for the ground was strewn with every sort of pitfall. At last&mdash;it
      seemed hours to Barton, it must have been an eternity to the sufferer&mdash;the
      hoarding was reached, and, after listening earnestly, Barton opened the
      door, peered out, saw that the coast was clear, deposited his burden on
      the pavement, and flew to the not distant police-station.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not absent long, and returning with four men and a stretcher, he
      found, of course, quite a large crowd grouped round the place where he had
      left his charge. The milkman was there, several shabby women, one or two
      puzzled policemen, three cabmen (though no wizard could have called up a
      cab at that hour and place had he wanted to catch a train;) there were
      riverside loafers, workmen going to their labor, and a lucky penny-a-liner
      with his "tissue" and pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pushing his way through these gapers, Barton found, as he expected, that
      his patient had fainted. He aided the policemen to place him on the
      stretcher, accompanied him to the infirmary (how common a sight is that
      motionless body on a stretcher in the streets!), explained as much of the
      case as was fitting to the surgeon in attendance, and then, at last,
      returned to his rooms and a bath, puzzling over the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove!" he said, as he helped himself to a devilled wing of a chicken
      at breakfast, "I believe the poor beggar had been experimenting with a
      Flying-Machine!"

      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;A Patient.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A doctor, especially a doctor actively practising among the poor and
      laborious, soon learns to take the incidents of his profession rather
      calmly. Barton had often been called in when a revel had ended in suicide
      or death; and if he had never before seen a man caught in a
      flying-machine, he had been used to heal wounds quite as dreadful caused
      by engines of a more familiar nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Barton, therefore, could go out to his round of visits on the day
      after his adventurous vigil without unusual emotion, it may be conceived
      that the distress and confusion at <i>The Bunhouse</i> were very great.
      The police and the gloomy attendants on Death were in the place; Mrs. St.
      John Deloraine had to see many official people, to answer many
      disagreeable questions, and suffered in every way extremely from the
      consequences of her beneficent enterprise. But she displayed a coolness
      and businesslike common sense worthy of a less versatile philanthropist,
      and found time, amid the temporary ruin of her work, to pay due attention
      to Margaret. She had scarcely noticed the girl before, taking her very
      much on trust, and being preoccupied with various schemes of social
      enjoyment. But now she was struck by her beauty and her educated manner,
      though that, to be sure, was amply accounted for by the explanations
      offered by Cranley before her engagement. Already Mrs. St. John Deloraine
      was conceiving a project of perpetual friendship, and had made up her mind
      to adopt Margaret as a daughter, or, let us say, niece and companion. The
      girl was too refined to cope with the rough-and-ready young patronesses of
      <i>The Bunhouse</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the lady's mind was even more preoccupied by the survivor in the
      hideous events of the evening than by the tragedy itself and the dead
      woman, Barton, too, found his thoughts straying to his new patient&mdash;not
      that he was a flirt or a sentimentalist. Even in the spring Barton's fancy
      did not lightly turn to thoughts of love. He was not one of those
      "amatorious" young men (as Milton says, perhaps at too great length) who
      cannot see a pretty girl without losing their hearts to her. Barton was
      not so prodigal of his affections; yet it were vain to deny that, as he
      went his rather drowsy round of professional visits, his ideas were more
      apt to stray to the girl who had been stabbed, than to the man who had
      been rescued from the machinery. The man was old, yellow, withered, and,
      in Barton's private opinion, more of a lunatic charlatan than a successful
      inventor. The girl was young, beautiful, and interesting enough, apart
      from her wound, to demand and secure a place in any fancy absolutely free.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no more than Barton's actual duty to call at <i>The Old English
      Bunhouse</i> in the afternoon. Here he was welcomed by Mrs. St John
      Deloraine, who was somewhat pale and shaken by the horrors of the night.
      She had turned all her young customers out, and had stuck up a paper
      bearing a legend to the effect that <i>The Old English Bunhouse</i> was
      closed for the present and till further notice. A wistful crowd was drawn
      up on the opposite side of the street, and was staring at <i>The Bunhouse</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St John Deloraine welcomed Barton, it might almost be said, with open
      arms. She had by this time, of course, laid aside the outward guise of <i>Nitouche</i>,
      and was dressed like other ladies, but better.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Barton," she exclaimed, "your patient is doing very well
      indeed. She will be crazy with delight when she hears that you have
      called."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton could not help being pleased at this intelligence, even when he had
      discounted it as freely as even a very brief acquaintance with Mrs. Si
      John Deloraine taught her friends to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think she is able to see me?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll run to her room and inquire," said Mrs. St John Deloraine, fleeting
      nimbly up the steep stairs, and leaving, like Astrsea, as described by
      Charles Lamb's friend, a kind of rosy track or glow behind her from the
      chastened splendor of her very becoming hose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton waited rather impatiently till the lady of <i>The Bunhouse</i>
      returned with the message that he might accompany her into the presence of
      the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very brief interview satisfied him that his patient was going on even
      better than he had hoped; also that she possessed very beautiful and
      melancholy eyes. She said little, but that little kindly, and asked
      whether Mr. Cranley had sent to inquire for her. Mrs. St. John Deloraine
      answered the question, which puzzled Barton, in the negative; and when
      they had left Margaret (Miss Burnside, as Mrs. St. John Deloraine called
      her), he ventured to ask who the Mr. Cranley might be about whom the girl
      had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," replied Mrs. St. John Deloraine, "it was through Mr. Cranley that
      I engaged both Miss Burnside and that unhappy woman whom I can't think of
      without shuddering. The inquest is to be held to-morrow. It is too
      dreadful when these things, that have been only names, come home to one.
      Now, I really do not like to think hardly of anybody, but I must admit
      that Mr. Cranley has quite misled me about the housekeeper. He gave her an
      excellent character, <i>especially</i> for sobriety, and till yesterday I
      had no fault to find with her. Then, the girls say, she became quite wild
      and intoxicated, and it is hard to believe that this is the first time she
      yielded to that horrid temptation. Don't you think it was odd of Mr.
      Cranley? And I sent round a messenger with a note to his rooms, but it was
      returned, marked, 'Has left; address not Known.' I don't know what has
      become of him. Perhaps the housekeeper could have told us, but the
      unfortunate woman is beyond reach of questions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean the Mr. Cranley who is Rector of St. Medard's, in Chelsea?"
      asked Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I mean Mr. Thomas Cranley, the son of the Earl of Birkenhead. He was
      a great friend of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Thomas Cranley!" exclaimed Barton, with an expression of face which
      probably spoke at least three volumes, and these of a highly sensational
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, please," cried Mrs. St. John Deloraine, clasping her hands in a
      pretty attitude of entreaty, like a recording angel hesitating to enter
      the peccadillo of a favorite saint; "please don't say you know anything
      against Mr. Cranley. I am aware that he has many enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton was silent for a minute. He had that good old school-boy feeling
      about not telling tales out of school, which is so English and so unknown
      in France; but, on the other side, <i>he</i> could scarcely think it right
      to leave a lady of invincible innocence at the mercy of a confirmed
      scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, it is a very unpleasant thing to have to say; but really,
      if you ask me, I should remark that Mr. Cranley's enemies are of his own
      making. I would not go to him for a girl's character, I'm sure. But I
      thought he had disappeared from society."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he had. He told me that there was a conspiracy against him, and that I
      was one of the few people who, he felt sure, would never desert him. And I
      never would. I never turn my back on my friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there was a conspiracy," said Barton, "I am the ringleader in it; for,
      as you ask me, I must assure you, on my honor, that I detected Mr. Cranley
      in the act of trying to cheat some very young men at cards. I would not
      have mentioned it for the world," he added, almost alarmed at the
      expression of pain and terror in Mrs. St John Deloraine's face; "but you
      wished to be told. And I could not honestly leave you in the belief that
      he is a man to be trusted. What he did when I saw him was only what all
      who knew him well would have expected. And his treatment of you, in the
      matter of that woman's character, was," cried Barton, growing indignant as
      he thought of it, "one of the very basest things I ever heard of. I had
      seen that woman before; she was not fit to be entrusted with the care of
      girls. She was at one time very well known."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. John Deloraine's face had passed through every shade of
      expression&mdash;doubt, shame, and indignation; but now it assumed an air
      of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Margaret has always spoken so well of him," she said, half to herself.
      "He was always very kind to her, and yet she was only the poor daughter of
      a humble acquaintance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he deviated into kindness for once," said Barton; "but as to his
      general character, it is certain that it was on a par with the trap he
      laid for you. I wish I knew where to find him. You must never let him get
      the poor girl back into his hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said Mrs. Si John Deloraine, with conviction in her
      voice; "and now I must go back to her, and see whether she wants anything.
      Do you think I may soon move her to my own house, in Cheyne Walk? It is
      not far, and she will be so much more comfortable there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best thing you can do," said Barton; "and be sure you send for me if
      you want me, or if you ever hear anything more of Mr. Cranley. I am quite
      ready to meet him anywhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will call to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, about this time," said Barton; and he kept his promise
      assiduously, calling often.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight went by, and Margaret, almost restored to health, and in a
      black tea-gown, the property of Mrs. St. John Deloraine, was lying
      indolently on a sofa in the house in Cheyne Walk. She was watching the
      struggle between the waning daylight and the fire, when the door opened,
      and the servant announced "Dr. Barton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret held forth a rather languid hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so sorry Mrs. St. John Deloraine is out," she said. "She is at a
      soap-bubble party. I wish I could go. It is so long since I saw any
      children, or had any fun."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Margaret spoke, and then she sighed, remembering the reason why she
      should not attend soap-bubble parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm selfish enough to be glad you could not go," said Barton; "for then I
      should have missed you. But why do you sigh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had a good many things to make me unhappy," said Margaret, "in
      addition to my&mdash;to my accident. You must not think I am always
      bewailing myself. But perhaps you know that I lost my father, just before
      I entered Mrs. St. John Deloraine's service, and then my whole course of
      life was altered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry for you," said Barton, simply. He did not know what else
      to say; but he felt more than his conventional words indicated, and
      perhaps he looked as if he felt it and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was still too weak to bear an expression of sympathy, and tears
      came into her eyes, followed by a blush on her pale, thin cheeks. She was
      on the point of breaking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing in the world so trying to a young man as to see a girl
      crying. A wild impulse to kiss and comfort her passed through Barton's
      mind, before he said, awkwardly again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell you how sorry I am; I wish I could do anything for you.
      Can't I help you in any way? You must not give up so early in the troubles
      of life; and then, who knows but yours, having begun soon, are nearly
      over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton would perhaps have liked to ask her to let him see that they <i>were</i>
      over, as far as one mortal can do as much for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have been going on so long," said Margaret "I have had such a
      wandering life, and such changes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton would have given much to be able to ask for more information; but
      more was not offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us think of the future," he said. "Have you any idea about what you
      mean to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. St. John Deloraine is very kind. She wishes me to stay with her
      always. But I am puzzled about Mr. Cranley. I don't know what he would
      like me to do. He seems to have gone abroad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton hated to hear her mention Cranley's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had you known him long?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; for a very short time only. But he was an old friend of my father's,
      and had promised him to take care of me. He took me away from school, and
      he gave me a start in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely he might have found something more worthy of you, of your
      education," said Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can a girl do?" answered Margaret. "We know so little. I could
      hardly even have taught very little children. They thought me dreadfully
      backward at school&mdash;at least, Miss&mdash;&mdash; I mean, the teachers
      thought me backward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure you know as much as anyone should," said Barton, indignantly.
      "Were you at a nice school?" he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been puzzling himself for many days over Margaret's history. She
      seemed to have had at least the ordinary share of education and knowledge
      of the world; and yet he had found her occupying a menial position at a
      philanthropic bunhouse. Even now she was a mere dependent of Mrs. St. John
      Deloraine, though there was a stanchness in that lady's character which
      made her patronage not precarious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were some nice girls at it," answered Margaret, without committing
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rochefoucauld declares that there are excellent marriages, but no such
      thing as a delightful marriage. Perhaps school-girls may admit, as an
      abstract truth, that good schools exist; but few would allow that any
      place of education is "nice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is really getting quite late," Barton observed, reluctantly. He liked
      to watch the girl, whose beauty, made wan by illness, received just a
      touch of becoming red from the glow of the fire. He liked to talk to her;
      in fact, this was his most interesting patient by far. It would be
      miserably black and dark in his lodgings, he was aware; and non-paying
      patients would be importunate in proportion to their poverty. The poor are
      often the most exacting of hypochondriacs. Margaret noticed his reluctance
      to go contending with a sense of what he owed to propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure you must want tea; but I don't like to ring. It is so short a
      time since I wore an apron and a cap and the rest of it myself at <i>The
      Bunhouse</i>, that I am afraid to ask the servants to do anything for me.
      They must dislike me; it is very natural."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not natural at all," said Barton, with conviction; "perfectly
      monstrous, on the other hand." This little compliment eclipsed the effect
      of fire-light on the girl's face. "Suppose I ring," he added, "and then
      you can say, when Mary says 'Did you ring, miss?' 'No, I didn't ring; but
      as you <i>are</i> here, Mary, would you mind bringing tea?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know if that would be quite honest," said Margaret, doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pious fraud&mdash;a drawing-room comedy," said Barton; "have we
      rehearsed it enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he touched the bell, and the little piece of private theatricals was
      played out, though one of the artists had some difficulty (as amateurs
      often have) in subduing an inclination to giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, this is quite perfect," said Barton, when he had been accommodated
      with a large piece of plum-cake. "This is the very kind of cake which we
      specially prohibit our patients to touch; and so near dinner-time, too!
      There should be a new proverb, 'Physician, diet thyself.' You see, we
      don't all live on a very thin slice of cold bacon and a piece of dry
      toast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. St John Deloraine has never taken up that kind of life," said
      Margaret. "She tries a good many new things," Barton remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but she is the best woman in the world!" answered the girl. "Oh, if
      you knew what a comfort it is to be with a lady again!" And she shuddered
      as she remembered her late chaperon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if some day&mdash;you won't think me very rude?" asked Barton&mdash;"you
      would mind telling me a little of your history?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Cranley ordered me to say nothing about it," answered Margaret; "and
      a great deal is very sad and hard to tell. You are all so kind, and
      everything is so quiet here, and safe and peaceful, that it frightens me
      to think of things that have happened, or may happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shall never happen, if you will trust me," cried Barton, when a
      carriage was heard to stop at the gateway of the garden outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is Mrs. St. John Deloraine at last," cried Margaret, starting to run
      to the window; but she was so weak that she tripped, and would have fallen
      had Barton not caught her lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how stupid you must think me!" she said, blushing. And Barton thought
      he had never seen anything so pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once for all, I don't think you stupid, or backward, or anything else
      that you call yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that very moment the door opened, and Mrs. St John Deloraine
      entered, magnificently comfortable in furs, and bringing a fresh air of
      hospitality and content with existence into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, <i>you</i> are here!" she cried, "and I have almost missed you. Now
      you <i>must</i> stay to dinner. You need not dress; we are all alone,
      Margaret and I."
    </p>
    <p>
      So he did stop to dine, and pauper hypochondriacs, eager for his society
      (which was always cheering), knocked, and rang also, at his door in vain.
      It was an excellent dinner; and, on the wings of the music Mrs. St John
      Deloraine was playing in the front drawing-room, two happy hours passed
      lightly over Barton and Margaret, into the backward, where all hours&mdash;good
      and evil&mdash;abide, remembered or forgotten.

      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;Another Patient.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Des ailes! des ailes! des ailes!
     Comme dans le chant de Ruckert."
     &mdash;Théophile Gautier.
</pre>
    <p>
      "So you think a flying machine impossible, sir, and me, I presume, a
      fanatic? Well, well, you have Eusebius with you. 'Such an one,' he says&mdash;meaning
      me, and inventors like me&mdash;'is a little crazed with the humors of
      melancholy.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker was the man whom Barton had rescued from the cogs and wheels
      and springs of an infuriated engine. Barton could not but be interested in
      the courage and perseverance of this sufferer, whom he was visiting in
      hospital. The young surgeon had gone to inspect the room in Paterson's
      Rants, and had found it, as he more or less expected, the conventional den
      of the needy inventor. Our large towns are full of such persons. They are
      the Treasure Hunters of cities and of civilization&mdash;the modern
      seekers for the Philosopher's Stone. At the end of a vista of dreams they
      behold the great Discovery made perfect, and themselves the winners of
      fame and of wealth incalculable.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the present, most of these visionaries are occupied with electricity.
      They intend to make the lightning a domestic slave in every house, and to
      turn Ariel into a common carrier. But, from the aspect of Winter's den in
      Paterson's Rents, it was easy to read that his heart was set on a more
      ancient foible. The white deal book-shelves, home-made, which lined every
      wall, were packed with tattered books on mechanics, and especially on the
      art of flying. Here you saw the spoils of the fourpenny box of cheap
      bookvendors mixed with volumes in better condition, purchased at a larger
      cost. Here&mdash;among the litter of tattered pamphlets and well-thumbed
      "Proceedings" of the Linnean and the Aeronautic Society of Great Britain&mdash;here
      were Fredericus Hermannus' "De Arte Volandi," and Cayley's works, and
      Hatton Turner's "Astra Castra," and the "Voyage to the Moon" of Cyrano de
      Bergerac, and Bishop Wilkins's "Dædalus," and the same sanguine prelate's
      "Mercury, The Secret Messenger." Here were Cardan and Raymond Lully, and a
      shabby set of the classics, mostly in French translations, and a score of
      lucubrations by French and other inventors&mdash;Ponton d'Amocourt,
      Borelli, Chabrier, Girard, and Marey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if his books had not shown the direction of the new patient's mind&mdash;(a
      man is known by his books at least as much as by his companions, and
      companions Winter had none)&mdash;even if the shelves had not spoken
      clearly, the models and odds-and-ends in the room would have proclaimed
      him an inventor. As the walls were hidden by his library, and as the
      floor, also, was littered with tomes and pamphlets and periodicals, a
      quantity of miscellaneous gear was hung by hooks from the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton, who was more than commonly tall, found his head being buffeted by
      big preserved wings of birds and other flying things&mdash;from the
      sweeping pinions of the albatross to the leathery covering of the bat.
      From the ceiling, too, hung models, cleverly constructed in various
      materials; and here&mdash;a cork with quills stuck into it, and with a
      kind of drill-bow&mdash;was the little flying model of Sir George Cayley.
      The whole place, dusty and musty, with a faded smell of the oil in birds'
      feathers, was almost more noisome than curious. When Barton left it, his
      mind was made up as to the nature of Winter's secret, or delusion; and
      when he visited that queer patient in hospital, he was not surprised
      either by his smattered learning or by his golden dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; Eusebius is against me, no doubt," Winter went on with his
      eager talk. "An acute man&mdash;rather <i>too</i> acute, don't you think,
      for a Father of the Church? That habit he got into of smashing the
      arguments of the heathen, gave him a kind of flippancy in talking of high
      matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such as flying?" put in Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; such as our great aim&mdash;the aim of all the ages, I may call it.
      What does Bishop Wilkins say, sir? Why, he says, (I doubt not but that
      flying in the air may be easily effected by a diligent and ingenious
      artificer.) 'Diligent,' I may say, I have been; as to 'ingenious,' I leave
      the verdict to others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was that Peter Wilkins you were quoting?" asked Barton, to humor his man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no sir; the Bishop was not Peter. Peter Wilkins is the hero of a
      mere romance, in which, it is true, we meet with women&mdash;<i>Goories</i>
      he calls them&mdash;endowed with the power of flight. But <i>they</i> were
      born so. We get no help from Peter Wilkins: a mere dreamer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't seem to be so easy as the Bishop fancies?" remarked Barton,
      leading him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," cried Winter, all his aches and pains forgotten, and his pale
      face flushed with the delight of finding a listener who did not laugh at
      him. "No, sir; the Bishop, though ingenious, was not a practical man. But
      look at what he says about the <i>weight</i> of your flying machine! Can
      anything be more sensible? Borne out, too, by the most recent researches,
      and the authority of Professor Pettigrew Bell himself. You remember the
      iron fly made by Begimontanus of Nuremberg?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The iron fly!" murmured Barton. "I can't say I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find a history of it in Bamus. This fly would leap from the
      hands of the great Begimontanus, flutter and buzz round the heads of his
      guests assembled at supper, and then, as if wearied, return and repose on
      the finger of its maker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to say you believe <i>that</i>?" asked Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not, sir; why not? Did not Archytas of Tarenturn, one of Plato's
      acquaintances, construct a wooden dove, in no way less miraculous? And the
      same Regimontanus, at Nuremberg, fashioned an eagle which, by way of
      triumph, did fly out of the city to meet Charles V. But where was I? Oh,
      at Bishop Wilkins. Cardan doubted of the iron fly of Regimontanus, because
      the material was so heavy. But Bishop Wilkins argues, in accordance with
      the best modern authorities, that the weight is no hindrance whatever, if
      proportional to the motive power. A flying machine, says Professor Bell,
      in the <i>Encyclopodia Britannica</i>&mdash;(you will not question the
      authority of the <i>Encyclopodia Britannica</i>?)&mdash;a flying machine
      should be 'a compact, moderately heavy, and powerful structure.' There,
      you see, the Bishop was right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours was deuced powerful," remarked Barton. "I did not expect to see two
      limbs of you left together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It <i>is</i> powerful, or rather it <i>was</i>," answered Winter, with a
      heavy sigh; "but it's all to do over again&mdash;all to do over again! Yet
      it was a noble specimen. 'The passive surface was reduced to a minimum,'
      as the learned author in the <i>Encyclopodia</i> recommends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! the passive surface was jolly near reduced to a mummy. <i>You</i>
      were the passive surface, as far as I could see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't laugh at me, please sir, after you've been so kind. All the rest
      laugh at me. You can't think what a pleasure it has been to talk to a
      scholar," and there was a new flush on the poor fellow's cheek, and
      something watery in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, my dear sir," cried Barton, greatly ashamed of
      himself. "Pray go on. The subject is entirely new to me. I had not been
      aware that there were any serious modern authorities in favor of the
      success of this kind of experiment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir," said Winter, much encouraged, and taking Barton's hand
      in his own battered claw; "thank you. But why should we run only to modern
      authorities? All great inventions, all great ideas, have been present to
      men's minds and hopes from the beginning of civilization. Did not
      Empedocles forestall Mr. Darwin, and hit out, at a stroke, the hypothesis
      of natural selection?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he <i>did</i> make a shot at it," admitted Barton, who remembered
      as much as that from "the old coaching days," and college lectures at St.
      Gatien's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what do we find? As soon as we get a whisper of civilization in
      Greece, we find Dædalus successful in flying. The pragmatic interpreters
      pretend that the fable does but point to the discovery of sails for ships;
      but I put it to you, is that probable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obvious bosh," said Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the meteorological mycologists, sir, <i>they</i> maintain that
      Dædalus is only the lightning flying in the breast of the storm!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing those fellows won't say," replied Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad you are with me, sir. In Dædalus <i>I</i> see either a record of
      a successful attempt at artificial flight, or at the very least, the
      expression of an aspiration as old as culture. <i>You</i> wouldn't make
      Dædalus the evening clouds accompanying Minos, the sun, to his setting in
      Sicily, in the west?" added Winter anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard of such nonsense," said Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Frederick Leighton, the President of the Royal Academy, is with me,
      sir, if I may judge by his picture of Dædalus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every sensible man must be with you," answered Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, I won't detain you with other famous flyers of antiquity, such
      as Abaris, mounted on an arrow, as described by Herodotus. Doubtless the
      arrow was a flying machine, a novelty to the ignorant Scythians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It <i>must</i> have been, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there was the Greek who flew before Nero in the circus; but he, I
      admit, had a bad fall, as Seutonius recounts. That character of Lucian's,
      who employed an eagle's wing and a vulture's in his flight, I take to be a
      mere figment of the satirist's imagination. But what do you make of Simon
      Magus? He, I cannot doubt, had invented a machine in which, like myself,
      he made use of steam or naphtha. This may be gathered from Arnobius, our
      earliest authority. He mentions expressly <i>currum Simonis Magi et
      quadrigas igneas</i>, the chariot of Simon Magus and his <i>vehicles of
      flame</i>&mdash;clearly the naphtha is alluded to&mdash;which vanished
      into air at the word of the Apostle Peter. The latter circumstances being
      miraculous, I take leave to doubt; but certainly Simon Magus had overcome
      the difficulties of aerial navigation. But, though Petrus Crinitus rejects
      the tradition as fabulous, I am prepared to believe that Simon Magus
      actually flew from the Capitol to the Aventine!
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The world knows nothing of its greatest men,'" quoted Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simon Magus has been the victim, sir, of theological acrimony, his
      character blackened, his flying machine impugned, or ascribed, as by the
      credulous Arnobius, to diabolical arts. In the dark ages, naturally, the
      science of Artificial Flight was either neglected or practised in secret,
      through fear of persecution. Busbequius speaks of a Turk at Constantinople
      who attempted something in this way; but he (the Turk, I mean), was
      untrammelled by ecclesiastical prejudice. But why should we tarry in the
      past? Have we not Mr. Proctor with us, both in <i>Knowledge</i> and the <i>Cornhill</i>?
      Does not the preeminent authority, Professor Pettigrew Bell, himself
      declare, with the weight, too, of the <i>Encyclopodia Britannica</i>, that
      'the number of successful flying models is considerable. It is not too
      much to expect,' he goes on, 'that the problem of artificial flight will
      be actually solved, or at least much simplified.' What less can we expect,
      as he observes, in the land of Watt and Stephenson, when the construction
      of flying machines has been 'taken up in earnest by practical men?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We may indeed," said Barton, "hope for the best when persons of your
      learning and ingenuity devote their efforts to the cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to my learning, you flatter me," said Winter. "I am no scholar; but an
      enthusiast will study the history of his subject Did I remark that the
      great Dr. Johnson, in these matters so sceptical, admits (in a romance, it
      is true) the possibility of artificial flight? The artisan of the Happy
      Valley expected to solve the problem in one year's time. 'If all men were
      equally virtuous,' said this artist, 'I should with equal alacrity teach
      them all to fly.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will keep your secret, like Dr. Johnson's artist?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To <i>you</i> I do not mind revealing this much. The vans or wings of my
      machine describe elliptic figures of eight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've seen them do <i>that</i>, said Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like the wings of birds; and have the same forward and downward stroke,
      by a direct piston action. The impetus is given, after a descent in air&mdash;which
      I effected by starting from a height of six feet only&mdash;by a
      combination of heated naphtha and of india rubber under torsion. By steam
      alone, in 1842, Philips made a model of a flying-machine soar across two
      fields. Penaud's machine, relying only on india rubber under torsion,
      flies for some fifty yards. What a model can do, as Bishop Wilkins well
      observes, a properly weighted and proportioned flying-machine, capable of
      carrying a man, can do also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But yours, when I first had the pleasure of meeting you, was not carrying
      you at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something had gone wrong with the mechanism," answered Winter, sighing.
      "It is always so. An inventor has many things to contend against. Remember
      Ark-wright, and how he was puzzled hopelessly by that trifling error in
      the thickness of the valves in his spinning machine. He had to give half
      his profits to Strutt, the local blacksmith, before Strutt would tell him
      that he had only to chalk his valves! The thickness of a coating of chalk
      made all the difference. Some trifle like that, depend on it, interfered
      with my machine. You see, I am obliged to make my experiments at night,
      and in the dark, for fear of being discovered and anticipated. I have been
      on the verge&mdash;nay, <i>over</i> the verge&mdash;of success. 'No
      imaginable invention,' Bishop Wilkins says, 'could prove of greater
      benefit to the world, or greater glory to the author.' A few weeks ago
      that glory was mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why a few weeks ago?" asked Barton. "Was your machine more advanced then
      than when I met you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot explain what had happened to check its motion," said Winter,
      wearily; "but a few weeks ago my <i>machine acted</i>, and I may say that
      I knew the sensations of a bird on the wing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that you actually <i>flew</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a very short distance, I did indeed, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton looked at him curiously: two currents of thought&mdash;one wild and
      credulous, the other practical and professional&mdash;surged and met in
      his brain. The professional current proved the stronger for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night," he said. "You are tiring and over-exciting yourself. I will
      call again soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      He <i>did</i> call again, and Winter told him a tale which will be
      repeated in its proper place.

     For Love, in sequel, works with Fate,

     &mdash;The Sleeping Beauty.
</pre>
    <p>
      That Margaret and Barton were losing their hearts to each other could not,
      of course, escape the keen eye of Mrs. St. John Deloraine. She noticed
      that Margaret, though perfectly restored to health, and lacking only the
      clear brown over the rose of her cheeks, was by no means so light of heart
      as in the very earliest days of her recovery. Love makes men and women
      poor company, and, to speak plainly, takes the fun out of them. Margaret
      was absent-minded, given to long intervals of silence, a bad listener&mdash;all
      of them things hateful to Mrs. St. John Delo-raine, but pardoned, in this
      instance, by the benevolent lady. Margaret was apt to blush without
      apparent cause, to start when a knock came to the door, to leave the room
      hurriedly, and need to be sought and brought back, when Barton called. Nor
      was Barton himself such good company as he had been. His manner was
      uncertain and constrained; his visits began to be paid at longer
      intervals; he seemed to have little to say, or talked in fits and starts;
      and yet he did not know how to go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Persons much less clear-sighted than Mrs. St John Deloraine could have
      interpreted, without difficulty, this awkward position of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, like most women of her kindly and impulsive character (when it has
      not been refined away into nothing by social hypocrisies), Mrs. St. John
      Deloraine was a perfectly reckless match-maker. She believed in love with
      her whole heart; it was a joy to her to mark the beginnings of inclination
      in two young souls, and she simply revelled in an "engagement." All
      considerations of economy, prudence, and foresight melted away before the
      ardor of her enthusiasm: to fall in love first, to get engaged next, and
      to be married as soon as possible afterward, without regard to
      consequences of any kind, were, in this lady's mind, heroic actions, and
      almost the whole duty of men and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her position, and with her opportunities, she soon knew all that was to
      be known about Margaret's affections, and also about Barton's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's as much in love with you as a man can be, my dear," she said to
      Margaret "Not worthy of him? Your past a barrier between you and him?
      Nonsense, Daisy; that is <i>his</i> affair. I know you are as good a girl
      as ever lived. Your father was poor, no doubt, and that wretched Mr.
      Cranley&mdash;yes, he was a wretch&mdash;had a spite against you. I don't
      know why, and you won't help me to guess. But Mr. Barton is too much of a
      man to let that kind of thing disturb him, I'm sure. You are afraid of
      something, Margaret Your nerves have been unstrung. I'm sure I don't
      wonder at it. I know what it is to lose one's nerve. I could no more drive
      now, as I used to do, or go at the fences I used to think <i>nothing</i>
      of! But once you are married to a man like Mr. Barton, who is there can
      frighten you? And as to being poor," and Mrs. St. John Deloraine explained
      her generous views as to arrangements on her part, which would leave
      Margaret far from portionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Margaret would cry a little, and lay her head on her friend's
      shoulder, and the friend would shed some natural tears for company; and
      they would have tea, and Barton would call, and look a great deal at his
      boots, and fidget with his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've no patience with you, Mr. Barton," said Mrs. St. John Deloraine at
      last, when she had so manouvred as to have some private conversation with
      him, and Barton had unpacked his heart. "I've no patience with you. Why,
      where is your courage? 'She has a history?' She's been persecuted. Well,
      where's your chivalry? Why don't you try your fortune? There never was a
      better girl, nor a pleasanter companion when she's not&mdash;when she's
      not disturbed by the nervousness of an undecided young man. If you don't
      take your courage in both hands, I will carry Margaret off on a yachting
      voyage to the Solomon Islands, or Jericho, or somewhere. Look here, I am
      going to take her for a drive in Battersea Park; it is handy, and looking
      very pretty, and as lonely as Tadmor in the wilderness. We will get out
      and saunter among the ponds. I shall be tired and sit down; you will show
      Margaret the marvels of natural history in the other pond, and when you
      come back you will both have made up your minds!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With this highly transparent ruse Barton expressed his content. The
      carriage was sent for, and in less than half an hour Barton and Margaret
      were standing alone, remote, isolated from the hum of men, looking at a
      pond where some water-hens were diving, while a fish ("coarse," but not
      uninteresting) occasionally flopped on the surface, The trees&mdash;it was
      the last week of May&mdash;were in the earliest freshness of their
      foliage; the air, for a wonder, was warm and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How quiet and pretty it is!" said Margaret "Who would think we were in
      London?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton said nothing. Like the French parrot, mentioned by Sir Walter
      Scott, he thought the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Burnside!" he exclaimed suddenly, "we have known each other now for
      some time."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a self evident proposition; but Margaret felt what was coming,
      and trembled. She turned for a moment, pretending to watch the movements
      of one of the water-fowls. Inwardly she was nerving herself to face the
      hard part of her duty, and to remind Barton of the mystery in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said at last; "we have known each other for some time, and yet&mdash;you
      know nothing about me."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words she lifted her eyes and looked him straight in the face.
      There seemed a certain pride and nobility in her he had not seen before,
      though her beautiful brown eyes were troubled, and there was a mark of
      pain on her brow. What was she going to tell him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton felt his courage come back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know one thing about you, and that is enough for me. I know I love
      you!" he said. "Margaret, can't you care for me a little? Don't tell me
      anything you think you should not say. I'm not curious."
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret turned back again to her inspection of the pond and its inmates,
      grasping the iron railing in front of her and gazing down into the waters,
      so that he could not see her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said at last, in a very low voice; "it would not be fair." Then,
      after another pause, "There is someone&mdash;" she murmured, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the last thing Barton had expected. If she did not care for <i>him</i>,
      he fancied she cared for nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you like someone better&mdash;" he was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't like him at all," interrupted Margaret. "He was very kind,
      but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then can't you like <i>me</i>?" asked Barton; and by this time he was
      very near her, and was looking down into her face, as curiously as she was
      still studying the natural history of Battersea Ponds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I should not; it is so difficult to know," murmured Margaret. And
      yet her rosy confusion, and beautiful lowered eyes, tender and ashamed,
      proved that she knew very well. Love is not always so blind but that
      Barton saw his opportunity, and was assured that she had surrendered. And
      he prepared, a conqueror, to march in with all the honors and rewards of
      war; for the place was lonely, and a covenant is no covenant until it is
      sealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he would have kissed her, Margaret disengaged herself gently,
      with a little sigh, and returned to the strong defensible position by the
      iron railings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must tell you about myself," she said. "I have promised never to tell,
      but I must. I have been so tossed about, and so weak, and so many things
      have happened." And she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      However impassioned a lover may be, he does naturally prefer that there
      should be no mystery about her he adores. Barton had convinced himself
      (aided by the eloquence and reposing on the feminine judgment of Mrs. St.
      John Deloraine) that Margaret could have nothing that was wrong to
      conceal. He could not look at her frank eyes and kind face and suspect
      her; though, to anyone but a lover, these natural advantages are no
      argument. He, therefore, prepared to gratify an extreme curiosity, and, by
      way of comforting and aiding Margaret, was on the point of assuming an
      affectionate attitude. But she moved a little away, and, still turning
      toward the friendly ponds, began her story:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The person&mdash;the gentleman whom I was thinking of was a friend of my
      father's, who, at one time, wanted him"&mdash;here Margaret paused&mdash;"wanted
      me to&mdash;to be his wife some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rapid imagination of Barton conjured up the figure of a well-to-do
      local pawnbroker, or captain of a trading vessel, as the selected spouse
      of Margaret. He fumed at the picture in his fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't like him much, though he certainly was very kind. His name&mdash;but
      perhaps I should not mention his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind," said Barton. "I dare say I never heard of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I should tell you, first of all, that my own name is not that which
      you, and Mrs. St. John Deloraine know me by. I had often intended to tell
      her; but I have become so frightened lately, and it seemed so mean to be
      living with her under a false name. But to speak of it brought so many
      terrible things back to mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Margaret," Barton whispered, taking her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both standing, at this moment, with their backs to the pathway,
      and an observer might have thought that they were greatly interested in
      the water-fowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is not Burnside," Margaret went on, glancing over her shoulder
      across the gardens and toward the river; "my name is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daisy Shields!" cried a clear voice. "Daisy, you're found at last, and
      I've found you! How glad Miss Marlett will be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But by this time the astonished Barton beheld Margaret in the impassioned
      embrace of a very pretty and highly-excited young lady; while Mrs. St.
      John Deloraine, who was with her, gazed with amazement in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear!" Miss Harman (for it was that enthusiast) hurried on, in a
      pleasant flow of talk, like a brook, with pleasant interruptions. "Oh, my
      dear! I was walking in the park with my maid, and I met Mrs. St. John
      Deloraine, and she said she had lost her friends, and I came to help her
      to look for them; and I've found <i>you!</i> It's like Stanley finding
      Livingstone. 'How I Found Daisy.' I'll write a book about it. And where <i>have</i>
      you been hiding yourself? None of the girls ever knew anything was the
      matter&mdash;only Miss Mariett and me! And I've left for good; and she and
      I are quite friends, and I'm to be presented next Drawing Room."
    </p>
    <p>
      While this address (which, at least, proved that Margaret had
      acquaintances in the highest circles) was being poured forth, Mrs. St.
      John Deloraine and Barton were observing all with unfeigned astonishment
      and concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both perceived that the mystery of Margaret's past was about to be
      dispelled, or rather, for Barton, it already <i>was</i> dispelled. The
      names of Shields and Miss Marlett had told <i>him</i> all that he needed
      to know. But he would rather have heard the whole story from his lady's
      lips; and Mrs. St. John Deloraine was mentally accusing Janey Harman of
      having interrupted a "proposal," and spoiled a darling scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was therefore with a certain most unfamiliar sharpness that Mrs. St
      John Deloraine, observing that the day was clouded over, requested
      Margaret to return to the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as Miss Harman seems to have <i>a great deal</i> to say to you,
      Margaret," added the philanthropic lady, "you two had better walk on as
      fast as you can; for <i>you</i> must be very careful not to catch cold! I
      see Miss Harman's maid waiting for her in the distance there. And you and
      I, Mr. Barton, if you will give me your arm, will follow slower; I'm not a
      good walker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Now</i>," said Barton's companion eagerly, when Margaret and Janey,
      about three yards in advance, might be conventionally regarded as beyond
      earshot&mdash;"<i>Now</i>, Mr. Barton, am I to congratulate you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton gave a little shamefaced laugh, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know&mdash;I hope so&mdash;I'm not sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you're not satisfactory&mdash;not at all satisfactory. Are you <i>still</i>
      shilly-shallying? What is the matter with young people?" cried the veteran
      of twenty-nine. "Or was it that wretched Janey, rushing in, like a cow in
      a conservatory? She's a regular school-girl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't that exactly, or at least that's not all. I hope&mdash;I think
      she does care for me, or will care for me, a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, bother!" said Mrs. St John Deloraine. She would not, for all the
      world, reveal the secrets of the confessional, and tell Barton what she
      knew of the state of Margaret's heart But she was highly provoked, and
      showed it in her manners, at no time applauded for their repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is," Barton admitted, "that I'm so taken by surprise I hardly
      know where I am! I do think, if I may say so without seeming conceited,
      that I have every reason to be happy. But, just as she was beginning to
      tell me about herself, that young lady, who seems to have known her at
      school, rushed in and explained the whole mystery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mrs. Si John Deloraine, turning a little pale and looking
      anxiously at Barton, "was it anything so very dreadful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She called her Daisy Shields," said Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I suppose she did! I always fancied, after what happened at <i>The
      Bunhouse</i>, that that dreadful Mr. Cranley sent her to me under a false
      name. It was not <i>her</i> fault. The question is, What was her reason
      for keeping her real name concealed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I'm coming to," said Barton. "I have a friend, a Mr.
      Maitland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Maitland of St. Gatien's?" asked the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I have often heard him speak of you," said Barton. "Well, he had a
      <i>protégée</i>&mdash;a kind of ward, to tell a long story in few words&mdash;a
      girl whom he had educated, and whom he was under some kind of promise to
      her father to marry. The father died suddenly; the girl disappeared
      mysteriously from school at the same moment; and Maitland, after many
      efforts, has never been able to find out anything about her. Now, this
      girl's name, this girl in whom my friend was interested, was Margaret
      Shields. That is the very name by which your friend, Miss Harman, called
      Margaret. So, you see, even if I am right, and if she <i>does</i> care for
      me, what a dreadful position I am in! I want to marry the girl to whom my
      friend is, more or less, engaged! My friend, after doing his best to find
      his ward, and after really suffering a great deal of anxiety and
      annoyance, is living abroad. What am I to say to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Barton," said Mrs. St John Deloraine, "perhaps you alarm yourself too
      much. I think"&mdash;here she dropped her voice a little&mdash;"I think&mdash;I
      don't think Mr. Maitland's <i>heart</i> is very deeply concerned about
      Miss Shields. I may be wrong, but I know him pretty well"&mdash;she gave a
      little nervous laugh&mdash;"and I don't think he's in <i>love</i> with
      Margaret."
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time she reached the end of this interrupted and tentative
      discourse Mrs. St. John Deloraine was blushing like a rose in June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton felt an enormous weight lifted from his heart, and a flood of
      welcome light poured into his mind. The two philanthropists were in love
      with each other!
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's an awfully good fellow, Maitland," he replied. "But you are right;
      I'm <i>sure</i> you are right. You must know. He is <i>not</i> in love
      with Margaret."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. John Deloraine seemed not displeased at the tribute to Maitland's
      unobtrusive virtues, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he will be very glad to hear that she is found at last, and quite
      safe; and I'll write to him myself, this very evening. I heard from him&mdash;about
      a charity, you know&mdash;a few days ago, and I have his address."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had reached the carriage. Janey, with many embraces,
      tore herself from Margaret, and went off with her attendant; while Mrs. St
      John Deloraine, with a beaming face, gave the coachman the order "Home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall see you to-morrow at luncheon," she cried to Barton; and no
      offer of hospitality had ever been more welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to walk home, turning over his discoveries in his thoughts, when
      he suddenly came to a dead halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By George!" he said out loud; "I'll go back and have it out with her at
      once. I've had enough of this shillyshally."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and strode off in the direction of Cheyne Walk. In a few minutes
      he was standing at the familiar door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you ask Miss&mdash;Miss Burnside if she can see me for one moment?"
      he said to the servant "I have forgotten something she wished me to do for
      her," he added in a mumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he was taken into the boudoir, and presently Margaret appeared, still
      in her bonnet and furs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't help coming back, Margaret," he said, as soon as she entered
      the room. "I want to tell you that it is all right, that you needn't think&mdash;I
      mean, that I know all about it, and that there is nothing, <i>nothing</i>
      to prevent us&mdash;I mean» Margaret, if you <i>really</i> care for me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he came to a dead stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a very easy situation. Barton could not exactly say to
      Margaret, "My dear girl, you need not worry yourself about Maitland. He
      does not care a pin for you; he'll be delighted at being released. He is
      in love with Mrs. St. John Deloraine."
    </p>
    <p>
      That would have been a statement both adequate and explicit; but it could
      not have been absolutely flattering to Margaret, and it would have been
      exceedingly unfair to her hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl came forward to the table, and stood with her hand on it, looking
      at Barton. She did not help him out in any way; her attitude was safe, but
      embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a charge, as it were, at the position&mdash;a random, desperate
      charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Margaret, can you trust me?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She merely put out her hand, which he seized.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, believe me when I tell you that I know everything about your
      doubts; that I know more than anyone else can do; and that there is <i>nothing</i>
      to prevent us from being happy. More than that, if you will only agree to
      make me happy, you will make everyone else happy too. Can't you take it on
      trust? Can't you believe me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret said nothing; but she hid her face on Barton's shoulder. She <i>did</i>
      believe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position was carried!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.&mdash;The Mark of Cain.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning Barton entered his sitting-room in very high spirits, and
      took up his letters. He had written to Maitland the night before, saying
      little but, "Come home at once. Margaret is found. She is going to be my
      wife. You can't come too quickly, if you wish to hear of something very
      much to your advantage." A load was off his mind, and he felt as <i>Romeo</i>
      did just before the bad news about <i>Juliet</i> reached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this buoyant disposition, Barton opened his letters. The first was in a
      hand he knew very well&mdash;that of a man who had been his fellow-student
      in Paris and Vienna, and who was now a prosperous young physician. The
      epistle ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Barton.&mdash;I'm off to the West of Ireland, for a fortnight People
      are pretty fit, as the season has not run far. Most of my patients have
      not yet systematically overeaten themselves. I want you to do something
      for me. Martin &amp; Wright, the lawyers, have a queer little bit of
      medical jurisprudence, about which young Wright, who was at Oriel in our
      time, asked my opinion. I recommended him to see you, as it is more in
      your line; and <i>my</i> line will presently be attached to that eminent
      general practitioner, 'The Blue Doctor.' May he prosper with the Galway
      salmon!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thine,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alfred Franks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucky beggar!" thought Barton to himself, but he was too happy to envy
      even a man who had a fortnight of salmon-fishing before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next letter he opened was in a blue envelope, with the stamp of
      Messrs. Martin &amp; Wright. The brief and and formal note which it
      contained requested Dr. Barton to call, that very day if possible, at the
      chambers of the respectable firm, on "business of great importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What in the world can they want?" thought Barton. "Nobody can have left
      <i>me</i> any money. Besides, Franks says it is a point in medical
      jurisprudence. That sounds attractive. I'll go down after breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked along the sunny embankment, and that bright prospect of houses,
      trees, and ships have never seemed so beautiful. In an hour he was in
      Lincoln's Inn Fields, and had shaken hands with young Wright, whom he
      knew; had been introduced to old Wright, a somewhat stately man of
      business, and had taken his seat in the chair sacred to clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Barton," said old Mr. Wright, solemnly, "you are, I think, the author
      of this book?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed to Barton a copy of his own volume, in its gray paper cover,
      "Les Tatouages Étude Médico-Légale".
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Barton. "I wrote it when I was in Paris I had plenty of
      chances of studying tattooing in the military hospitals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not read it myself," said old Mr. Wright, "because I am not
      acquainted with the French language; but my son tells me it is a work of
      great learning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton could only bow, and mutter that he was glad Mr. Wright liked it. <i>Why</i>
      he should like it, or what the old gentleman wanted, he could not even
      imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are at present engaged in a very curious case, Dr. Barton," went on
      the lawyer, "in which we think your special studies may assist us. The
      position is this: Nearly eight months ago a client of ours died, a Mr.
      Richard Johnson, of Linkheaton, in the North. You must excuse me if I seem
      to be troubling you with a long story?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton mentioned that he was delighted, and added, "Not at all," in the
      vague modern dialect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Mr. Richard Johnson, then, was a somewhat singular character. He was
      what is called a 'statesman' in the North. He had a small property of
      about four hundred acres, on the marches, as they say, or boarders of the
      Earl of Birkenhead's lands. Here he lived almost alone, and in a very
      quiet way. There was not even a village near him, and there were few
      persons of his own position in life, because his little place was almost
      embedded, if I may say so, in Lord Birkenhead's country, which is
      pastoral. You are with me, so far?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly," said Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Mr. Johnson, then, lived quite alone, with an old housekeeper, dead
      since his decease, and with one son, called Richard, like himself. The
      young man was of an adventurous character, a ne'er-do-weel in fact; and
      about twenty years ago he left Linkheaton, after a violent quarrel with
      his father. It was understood that he had run away to sea. Two years later
      he returned; there was another quarrel, and the old man turned him out,
      vowing that he would never forgive him. But, not long after that, a very
      rich deposit of coal&mdash;a <i>very</i> rich deposit," said Mr. Wright,
      with the air of a man tasting most excellent claret&mdash;"was discovered
      on this very estate of Linkheaton. Old Johnson, without much exertion on
      his part, and simply through the payment of royalties by the company that
      worked the coal, became exceedingly opulent, in what you call most
      affluent circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Wright paused, as if to see whether Barton was beginning to
      understand the point of the narrative, which, it is needless to remark, he
      was <i>not</i>. There is no marked connection between coal mines, however
      lucrative, and "Les Tatouages, Étude Médico-Légale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In spite of his wealth, Mr. Johnson in no way changed his habits. He
      invested his money carefully, under our advice, and he became, as I said,
      an extremely warm man. But he continued to live in the old farmhouse, and
      did not, in any way, court society. To tell the truth, except Lord
      Birkenhead, who is our client, I never knew anyone who was at all intimate
      with the old man. Lord Birkenhead had a respect for him, as a neighbor and
      a person of the old-fashioned type. Yes," Mr. Wright added, seeing that
      his son was going to speak, "and, as you were about to say, Tom, they were
      brought together by a common misfortune. Like old Mr. Johnson, his
      lordship has a son who is very, very&mdash;unsatisfactory. His lordship
      has not seen the Honorable Mr. Thomas Cranley for many years; and in that
      lonely country the two boys had been companions in wild amusements, long
      before. He is <i>very</i> unsatisfactory, the Honorable Thomas Cranley;"
      and Mr. Wright sighed heavily, in sympathy with a client so noble and so
      afflicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know the beast," said Barton, without reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wright looked at him in amazement and horror. "The beast!" A son of
      Lord Birkenhead's called "The beast!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To return to our case, Dr. Barton," he went on severely, with some stress
      laid on the <i>doctor</i>. "Mr. Johnson died, leaving, by a will made on
      his death-bed, all that he possessed to his son Richard, or, in case of
      his decease, to the heirs of his body lawfully begotten. From that day to
      this we have hunted everywhere for the man. We have traced him all over
      the world; we have heard of him in Australia, Burmah, Guiana, Smyrna, but
      at Smyrna we lose sight of him. This advertisement," said the old
      gentleman, taking up the outside sheet of the <i>Times</i>, and folding it
      so as to bring the second column into view, "remained for more than seven
      months unanswered, or only answered by impostors and idiots."
    </p>
    <p>
      He tapped his finger on the place as he handed the paper to Barton, who
      read aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Linkheaton.&mdash;If Richard Johnson, of Linkheaton, Durham, last heard
      of at Smyrna in 1875, will apply to Messrs. Martin and Wright, Lincoln's
      Inn Fields, he will hear of something very greatly to his advantage. His
      father died, forgiving him. A reward of £1,000 will be paid to anyone
      producing Richard Johnson, or proving his decease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a mixture of business with the home affections," said old Mr. Wright
      proudly (for the advertisement was of his own composition), "I think that
      leaves little ta be desired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is admirable," said Barton&mdash;"admirable; but may I ask&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where the tattooing comes in?" said Mr. Wright. "I am just approaching <i>that</i>.
      The only person from whom we received any reliable information about
      Richard Johnson was an old ship-mate of his, a wandering, adventurous
      character, now, I believe, in Paraguay, where we cannot readily
      communicate with him. According to his account, Johnson was an ordinary
      seafaring man, tanned, and wearing a black beard, but easily to be
      recognized for an excellent reason. <i>He was tattooed almost all over his
      whole body</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton nearly leaped out of his chair, the client's chair, so sudden a
      light flashed on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, Dr. Barton! I <i>thought</i> I should interest you;
      but you seem quite excited."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really beg your pardon," said Barton. "It was automatic, I think;
      besides, I <i>am</i> extremely interested in tattooing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, sir, it is a pity you could not have seen Johnson. He appears, from
      what our informant tells us, to have been a most remarkable specimen. He
      had been tattooed by Australian blacks, by Burmese, by Arabs, and, in a
      peculiar blue tint and to a particular pattern, by the Dyacks of Borneo.
      We have here a rough chart, drawn by our informant, of his principal
      decorations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the lawyer solemnly unrolled a great sheet of drawing-paper, on which
      was rudely outlined the naked figure of a man, filled up, on the breast,
      thighs, and arms, with ornamental designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guess which made Barton leap up had not been mistaken: he recognized
      the tattooings he had seen on the dead body of Dicky Shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      This confirmation of what he had conjectured, however, did not draw any
      exclamation or mark of excitement from Barton, who was now on his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is highly interesting," he said, as he examined the diagram; "and I
      am sure, Mr. Wright, that it should not be difficult to recognize a
      claimant with such remarkable peculiarities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; it is easy enough, and we have been able to dismiss scores of
      sham Richard Johnsons. But one man presented himself the day before
      yesterday&mdash;a rough sailor fellow, who went straight to the point;
      asked if the man we wanted had any private marks; said he knew what they
      were, and showed us his wrist, which exactly, as far as we could verify
      the design, corresponded to that drawing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," asked Barton, controlling his excitement by a great effort, "what
      did you do with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We said to him that it would be necessary to take the advice of an expert
      before we could make any movement; and, though he told us things about old
      Johnson and Linkheaton, which it seemed almost impossible that anyone but
      the right man could have known, we put him off till we had seen you, and
      could make an appointment for you to examine the tattooings. <i>They</i>
      must be dealt with first, before any other identification."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you have made some other necessary inquiries? Did he say why he
      was so late in answering the advertisement? It has been out for several
      months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and that is rather in his favor," said Mr. Wright. "If he had been
      an impostor on the lookout he would probably have come to us long ago. But
      he has just returned from the Cape, where he had been out of the way of
      newspapers, and he did not see the advertisement till he came across it
      three or four days ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Barton. "Make an appointment with the man for any time
      to-morrow, and I will be with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this he looked very hard and significantly at the younger Mr.
      Wright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, sir; thank you. Shall we say at noon tomorrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With pleasure," answered Barton, still with his eye on the younger
      partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then said good-by, and was joined, as he had hoped, in the outer office
      by young Wright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had something to say to me?" asked the junior member of the firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Several things," said Barton, smiling. "And first, would you mind finding
      out whether the coast is clear&mdash;whether any one is watching for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watching for you! What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just take a look round the square, and tell me whether any suspicious
      character is about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Wright, much puzzled, put on his hat, and stood lighting a cigarette
      on the outer steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a soul in sight but lawyers' clerks," he reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; just tell your father that, as it is a fine morning, you are
      taking a turn with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton's friend did as he wished, and presently the pair had some serious
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll do exactly as you suggest, and explain to my father," said the young
      lawyer as they separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks; it is so much easier for you to explain than for a stranger like
      myself," said Barton, and strolled westward by way of Co vent Garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the noted establishment of Messrs. Aminadab, theatrical costumiers,
      Barton stopped, went in, was engaged some time with the Messrs. Aminadab,
      and finally had a cab called for him, and drove home with a pretty bulky
      parcel.
    </p>

    <p>
      At five minutes to twelve on the following day, a tall, burly,
      mahogany-colored mariner, attired, for the occasion, in a frock-coat and
      hat, appeared in Lincoln's Inn Fields. He seemed to be but ill acquainted
      with those coasts, and mooned about for some minutes before he reached the
      door of Messrs. Wright Then he rang, the door was opened, and he was
      admitted into the presence of the partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come, gentlemen, in answer to your letter," he said with a
      Northern burr, bowing awkwardly, and checking a disposition to salute by
      touching his forelock.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes wandered round the room, where he saw no one but the partners,
      with whom he was already acquainted, and a foreign-looking gentleman&mdash;a
      gentleman with hay-colored hair, a soft hat, spectacles, and a tow-colored
      beard. He had a mild, short-sighted expression, a pasty complexion, and
      the air of one who smoked too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Mr.&mdash;h'm&mdash;Mr. Johnson," said old Mr. Wright. "As
      we told you, sir, we have, as a necessary preliminary to the inquiry,
      requested Professor Lieblein to step in and inspect&mdash;h'm&mdash;the
      personal marks of which you spoke. Professor Lieblein, of Bonn, is a great
      authority on these matters&mdash;author of 'Die Tattuirung,' a very
      learned work, I am told."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus introduced, the Professor bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to meet you, sir," said the sailor-man gruffly, "or any gentleman as
      really knows what's what."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been a great traveller, sir?" said the learned Professor, whose
      Teutonic accent it is superfluous to reproduce. "You have in many lands
      travelled? So!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; I have seen the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are much tattooed: it is to me very interesting. You have by many
      races been decorated?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most niggers have had a turn at me, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How happy you are to have had such experiences! Now, the Burmese&mdash;ah!
      have you any little Burmese marks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; from the elbow to the shoulder," replied the seafaring man.
      "Saving your presence, I'll strip to the buff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The buff! What is that? Oh, thank you, sir," this was in reply to young
      Mr. Wright "The naked body! why, buff! 'Buff,' the abstract word, the
      actual stuff, the very <i>wesen</i> of man unclothed. 'Buffer,' the
      concrete man, in the 'buff,' in the flesh; it is <i>sehr intéressant</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      While the learned Professor muttered these metaphysical and philological
      reflections, the seaman was stripping himself to the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the Burmese style, sir," he said, pointing to his shoulders and
      upper arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      These limbs were tattooed in a beautiful soft blue; the pattern was a
      series of diminishing squares, from which long narrow triangles ran down
      to the elbow-joints.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Sehr schôn, sehr schôn</i>," exclaimed the delighted Professor. "It is
      very <i>hubsch</i>, very pretty, very well. We cannot now decorate, we
      Germans. Ach, it is mournful!" and he sighed. "And now, sir, have you to
      show me any <i>moko</i>? A little <i>moko</i> would be very instructive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moko? Rather! The Maori pattern, you mean; the New Zealand dodge? Just
      look between my shoulders," and the seaman turned a broad bare back,
      whereon were designs of curious involuted spirals.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is right, that is right," whispered the Professor. "<i>Moko,
      schlange</i>, serpent-marks, so they call it in their tongue. Better <i>moko</i>,
      on an European man, have I never seen. You observe," he remarked to the
      elder Mr. Wright, waving his hand as he followed the tattooed lines&mdash;"you
      observe the serpentine curves? Very beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Extremely interesting," said Mr. Wright, who, being no anthropologist,
      seemed nervous and uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corresponds, too, with the marks in the picture," he added, comparing the
      sketch of the original Shields with the body of the claimant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you satisfied now, governor?" asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One little moment. Have you on the Red Sea coast been? Have you been at
      Suakim? Have you any Arab markings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes; here you are!" and the voyager pointed to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor inspected, with unconcealed delight, some small tattooings
      of irregular form.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, it is," he cried, "the <i>wasm</i>, the <i>sharat</i>,* the
      Semitic tribal mark, the mark with which the Arab tribes brand their
      cattle! Of old time they did tattoo it on their bodies. The learned Herr
      Professor Robertson Smith, in his leedle book, do you know what he calls
      that very mark, my dear sir?"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Sharat or Short.&mdash;"The shart was in old times a tattooed
     mark.... In the patriarchal story of Cain...the institution
     of blood revenge is connected with a 'mark' which Jehovah
     appoints to Cain. Can this be anything else than the
     <i>sharat</i>, or tribal mark, which every man bore on his
     person?"
     &mdash;Robertson Smith, <i>Kinship in Ancient Arabia</i>, p.215.
</pre>
    <p>
      "Not I," said the sailor; "I'm no scholar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says it was&mdash;I do not say he is right," cried the Professor, in a
      loud voice, pointing a finger at his victim's breast&mdash;"he says it was
      <i>the mark of cain</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor, beneath his mahogany tan, turned a livid white, and grasped at
      a bookcase by which he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" he cried, through his chattering teeth; "what do you
      mean with your damned Hebrew-Dutch and your mark of Cain? The mark's all
      right! A Hadendowa woman did it in Suakim years ago. Ain't it on that
      chart of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, good sir; it is," answered the Professor. "Why do you so
      agitate yourself? <i>The proof is complete!</i>" he added, still pointing
      at the sailor's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll put on my togs, with your leave: it's none so warm!" grumbled
      the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had so far completed his dressing that he was in his waistcoat, and was
      just looking round for his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop!" said the Professor. "Hold Mr. Johnson's coat for a moment!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was to young Wright, who laid his hands on the garment in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be tired, sir," said the Professor, in a very soft voice. "May I
      offer you a leedle cigarette?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew from his pocket a silver cigarette-case, and, in a thoroughly
      English accent, he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have waited long to give you back your cigarette-case, which you left
      at your club, Mr. Thomas Cranley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor's eye fell on it. He dashed the silver box violently to the
      ground, and trampled on it, then he made one rush at his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold it, hold it!" cried Barton, laying aside his Teutonic accent&mdash;"hold
      it: there's a revolver in the pocket!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no need to struggle for the coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor had suddenly staggered and fallen, a crumpled but not
      unconscious mass, on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call in the police!" said Barton. "They'll have no difficulty in taking
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the man against whom you have the warrant," he went on, as young
      Wright opened the door and admitted two policemen. "I charge the Honorable
      Thomas Cranley with murder!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers lifted the fallen man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him be," said Barton. "He has collapsed. Lay him on the floor: he's
      better so. He needs a turn of my profession: his heart's weak. Bring some
      brandy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Wright went for the spirits, while the frightened old lawyer kept
      murmuring:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Honorable Thomas Cranley <i>was</i> always very unsatisfactory!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been explained to the old gentleman that an impostor would be
      unmasked, and a criminal arrested; but he had <i>not</i> been informed
      that the culprit was the son of his great client, Lord Birkenhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton picked up the cigarette-case, and as he, for the first time,
      examined its interior, some broken glass fell out and tinkled on the
      floor.

      CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;The Verdict of Fate.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Maitland did not dally long in the Levant after getting Barton's letter.
      He was soon in a position to receive, in turn, the congratulations which
      he offered to Margaret and Barton with unaffected delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. John Deloraine and he understood each other!
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland, for perhaps the first time in his life, was happy in a
      thoroughly human old-fashioned way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the preparations for Cranley's trial dragged on. Interest, as
      usual, was frittered away in examinations before the magistrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last the day of judgment shone into a court crowded as courts are
      when it is the agony of a gentleman that the public has to view.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the prisoner, uttering his last and latest falsehood, proclaimed
      himself "Not Guilty," his voice was clear and strong enough, though the
      pallor of his face attested, not only the anxiety of his situation, but
      the ill-health which, during his confinement, had often made it doubtful
      whether he could survive to plead at the bar of any earthly judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Counsel for the Crown, opening the case, stated the theory of the
      prosecution, the case against Cranley. His argument is here offered in a
      condensed form:
    </p>
    <p>
      First, Counsel explained the position of Johnson, or Shields, as the
      unconscious heir of great wealth, and set forth his early and late
      relations with the prisoner, a dishonored and unscrupulous outcast of
      society. The prisoner had been intimately acquainted with the
      circumstances of Johnson's early life, with his history and his home. His
      plan, therefore, was to kill him, and then personate him. A celebrated
      case, which would be present to the minds of the jury, proved that a most
      plausible attempt at the personation of a long-missing man might be made
      by an uneducated impostor, who possessed none of the minute local and
      personal knowledge of the prisoner. Now, to personate Johnson, a sailor
      whose body was known to have been indelibly marked by the tattooing of
      various barbarous races, it was necessary that the prisoner should be
      similarly tattooed. It would be shown that, with unusual heartlessness, he
      had persuaded his victim to reproduce on his body the distinctive marks of
      Johnson, and then had destroyed him with fiendish ingenuity, in the very
      act of assuming his personality. The very instrument, it might be said,
      which stamped Cranley as Johnson, slew Johnson himself, and the process
      which hallmarked the prisoner as the heir of vast wealth stigmatized him
      with the brand of Cain. The personal marks which seemed to establish the
      claimant's case demonstrated his guilt He was detected by the medical
      expert brought in to prove his identity, and was recognized by that
      gentleman, Dr. Barton, who would be called, and who had once already
      exposed him in a grave social offence&mdash;cheating at cards. The same
      witness had made a <i>post-mortem</i> examination of the body of Richard
      Johnson, and had then suspected the method by which he had been murdered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murder itself, according to the theory of the prosecution, was
      committed in the following manner: Cranley, disguised as a sailor (tbe
      disguise in which he was finally taken), had been in the habit of meeting
      Johnson, and being tattooed by him, in a private room of the <i>Hit or
      Miss</i> tavern, in Chelsea. On the night of February 7th, he met him
      there for the last time. He left the tavern late, at nearly twelve
      o'clock, telling the landlady that "his friend," as he called Johnson, had
      fallen asleep upstairs. On closing the establishment, the landlady, Mrs.
      Gullick, found the room, an upper one, with dormer windows opening on the
      roof, empty. She concluded that Johnson&mdash;or Shields, as she called
      him&mdash;had wakened, and left the house by the back staircase, which led
      to a side-alley. This way Johnson, who knew the house well, often took, on
      leaving. On the following afternoon, however, the dead body of Johnson,
      with no obvious marks of violence on it, was found in a cart belonging to
      the vestry&mdash;a cart which, during the night, had remained near a shed
      on the piece of waste ground adjoining the <i>Hit or Miss</i>. A coroner's
      jury had taken the view that Johnson, being intoxicated, had strayed into
      the piece of waste ground (it would be proved that the door in the
      palisade surrounding it was open on that night), had lain down in the
      cart, and died in his sleep of cold and exposure. But evidence derived
      from a later medical examination would establish the presumption, which
      would be confirmed by the testimony of an eye-witness, that death had been
      wilfully caused by Cranley, employing a poison which it would be shown he
      had in his possession&mdash;a poison which was not swallowed by the
      victim, but introduced by means of a puncture into the system. The dead
      man's body had then been removed to a place where his decease would be
      accounted for as the result of cold and exhaustion. A witness would be put
      in the box who, by an extraordinary circumstance, had been enabled to see
      the crime committed by the prisoner, and the body carried away, though, at
      the moment, he did not understand the meaning of what he saw. As the
      circumstances by which this witness had been enabled to behold what was
      done at dead of night, in an attic room, locked and bolted, and not
      commanded from any neighboring house nor eminence, were exceedingly
      peculiar, testimony would be brought to show that the witness really had
      enjoyed the opportunity of observation which he claimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, then, as the prisoner had undeniably personated Johnson, and
      claimed Johnson's property; as he undeniably had induced Johnson,
      unconsciously, to aid him in the task of personation; as the motive for
      the murder was plain and obvious; as Johnson, according to the medical
      evidence, had probably been murdered; and as an eye-witness professed to
      have seen, without comprehending, the operation by which death, according
      to the medical theory, was caused, the counsel for the prosecution
      believed that the jury could find no other verdict than that the prisoner
      had wilfully murdered Richard Johnson on the night of February 7th.
    </p>
    <p>
      This opened the case for the Crown. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the
      evidence of all the witnesses who proved, step by step, the statements of
      the prosecution. First was demonstrated the identity of Shields with
      Johnson. To do this cost enormous trouble and expense; but Johnson's old
      crony, the man who drew the chart of his tattoo marks, was at length
      discovered in Paraguay, and, by his aid and the testimony he collected,
      the point was satisfactorily made out. It was, of course, most important
      in another respect, as establishing Margaret's claims on the Linkheaton
      estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery of the body of Johnson (or Shields) in the snow was proved
      by our old friends Bill and Tommy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner was recognized by Mrs. Gullick as the sailor gentleman who
      had been with Johnson on the last night of his life. In spite of the
      difference of dress, and of appearance caused by the absence of beard&mdash;for
      Cranley was now clean shaved&mdash;Mrs. Gullick was positive as to his
      voice and as to his eyebrows, which were peculiarly black and mobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton, who was called next, and whose evidence excited the keenest
      interest, identified the prisoner as the man whom he had caused to be
      arrested in the office of Messrs. Martin and Wright, and whom he had known
      as Cranley. His medical evidence was given at considerable length, and
      need not be produced in full detail On examining the body of Richard
      Johnson, his attention had naturally been directed chiefly to the
      tattooings. He had for some years been deeply interested, as an
      ethnologist, in the tattooed marks of various races. He had found many
      curious examples on the body of the dead man. Most of the marks were
      obviously old; but in a very unusual place, generally left blank&mdash;namely,
      behind and under the right shoulder&mdash;he had discovered certain
      markings of an irregular character, clearly produced by an inexperienced
      hand, and perfectly fresh and recent. They had not healed, and were
      slightly discolored. They could not, from their position, possibly have
      been produced by the man himself. Microscopic examinations of these marks,
      in which the coloring matter was brown, not red or blue, as on the rest of
      the body, showed that this coloring matter was of a character familiar to
      the witness as a physiologist and scientific traveller. It was the <i>Woorali</i>,
      or arrow poison of the Macoushi Indians of Guiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asked to explain the nature of this poison to the Court, the witness said
      that its "principle" (to use the term of the old medical writers) had not
      yet been disengaged by Science, nor had it ever been compounded by
      Europeans. He had seen it made by the Macoushi Indians, who combined the
      juice of the Woorali vine with that of certain bulbous plants, with
      certain insects, and with the poison-fangs of two serpents, boiling the
      whole amidst magical ceremonies, and finally straining off a thick brown
      paste, which, when perfectly dry, was used to venom the points of their
      arrows. The poison might be swallowed by a healthy man without fatal
      results. But if introduced into the system through a wound, the poison
      would act almost instantaneously, and defy analysis. Its effect was to
      sever, as it were, the connection between the nerves and the muscles, and
      the muscles used in respiration being thus gradually paralyzed, death
      followed within a brief time, proportionate to the size of the victim, man
      or animal, and the strength of the dose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traces of this poison, then, the witness had found in the fresh tattoo
      marks on Johnson's body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The witness now produced the sharp wooden needle, the stem of the leaf of
      the coucourite palm, which he had found among Johnson's tattooing
      materials, in the upper chamber of the <i>Hit or Miss</i>. This needle had
      been, he said, the tip of one of the arrows used for their blowpipes, by
      the Macoushi of Guiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton also produced the Oriental silver cigarette-case, the instrument of
      his cheating at baccarat, which Cranley had left in the club on the
      evening of his detection. He showed that the case had contained a small
      crystal receptacle, intended to hold opium. This crystal had been broken
      by Cranley when he dashed down the case, in the office of Martin and
      Wright. But crumbs of the poison&mdash;"Woorali," or "Ourali"&mdash;perfectly
      dry, remained in this réceptacle. It was thus clear that Cranley, himself
      a great traveller, was possessed of the rare and perilous drug.
    </p>
    <p>
      The medical evidence having been heard, and confirmed in its general
      bearing by various experts, and Barton having stood the test of a severe
      cross-examination, William Winter was called.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a flutter in the Court, as a pale and partly paralyzed man was
      borne in on a kind of litter, and accommodated in the witness-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where were you," asked the counsel for the prosecution, when the officer
      had sworn the witness, "at eleven o'clock on the night of February 7th?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was on the roof of the <i>Hit or Miss</i> tavern."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On which part of the roof?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the ledge below the dormer window at the back part of the house,
      facing the waste ground behind the plank fence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you tell the Court what you saw while you were in that position?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Winter's face was flushed with excitement; but his voice, though thin, was
      clear as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was a light streaming through the dormer window beside which I was
      lying, and I looked in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw a small room, with a large fire, a table, on which were bottles and
      glasses, and two men, one seated, the other standing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you recognize either man if you saw him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I recognize the man who was seated, in the prisoner at the bar; but at
      that time he wore a beard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell the Court what happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The men were facing me. One of them&mdash;the prisoner&mdash;was naked to
      the waist. His breast was tattooed. The other&mdash;the man who stood up&mdash;was
      touching him with a needle, which he applied, again and again, to a saucer
      on the table."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you hear what they said?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could; for the catch of the lattice window had not caught, and there
      was a slight chink open."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You listened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not help it; the scene was so strange. I heard the man with the
      needle give a sigh of relief, and say, 'There, it's finished, and a pretty
      job too, though I say it.' The other said, 'You have done it beautifully,
      Dicky; it's a most interesting art. Now, just out of curiosity, let <i>me</i>
      tattoo <i>you</i> a bit.' The other man laughed, and took off his coat and
      shirt while the other dressed. 'There's scarce an inch of me plain,' he
      said, 'but you can try your hand here,' pointing to the lower part of his
      shoulder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What happened then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were both standing up now. I saw the prisoner take out something
      sharp; his face was deadly pale, but the other could not see that. He
      began touching him with the sharp object, and kept chaffing all the time.
      This lasted, I should think, about five minutes, when the face of the man
      who was being tattooed grew very red. Then he swayed a little, backward
      and forward, then he stretched out his hands like a blind man, and said,
      in a strange, thick voice, as if he was paralyzed, 'I'm very cold; I can't
      shiver!' Then he fell down heavily, and his body made one or two
      convulsive movements. That was all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did the prisoner do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looked like death. He seized the bottle on the table, poured out half
      a tumbler full of the stuff in it, drank it off, and then fell into a
      chair, and laid his face between his hands. He appeared ill, or alarmed,
      but the color came back into his cheek after a third or fourth glass. Then
      I saw him go to the sleeping man and bend over him, listening apparently
      to his breathing. Then he shook him several times, as if trying to arouse
      him. But the man lay like a log. Finally, about half-an-hour after what I
      have described, he opened the door and went out. He soon returned, took up
      the sleeping man in his arms&mdash;his weight seemed lighter than you
      would expect&mdash;and carried him out. From the roof I saw him push the
      door in the palisade leading into the waste land, a door which I myself
      had left open an hour before. It was not light enough to see what he did
      there; but he soon returned alone and walked away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the sum of Winter's evidence, which, if accepted, entirely
      corroborated Barton's theory of the manner of the murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cross-examination, Winter was asked the very natural question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you come to find yourself on the roof of the <i>Hit or Miss</i>
      late at night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Winter nearly rose from his litter, his worn faced flushed, his eye
      sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I flew!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur and titter through the court, which was, of course,
      instantly suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You flew! What do you mean by saying that you flew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the inventor of a flying machine, which, for thirty years, I have
      labored at and striven to bring to perfection. On that one night, as I was
      experimenting with it, where I usually did, inside the waste land
      bordering on the <i>Hit or Miss</i>, the machine actually worked, and I
      was projected in the machine, as it were, to some height in the air,
      coming down with à fluttering motion, like a falling feather, on the roof
      of the <i>Hit or Miss</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the learned counsel for the defence smiled with infinite expression
      at the jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," said the counsel for the prosecution, noting the smile, and the
      significant grin with which it was reflected on the countenances of the
      twelve good men and true, "I may state that we are prepared to bring
      forward a large mass of scientific evidence&mdash;including a well-known
      man of science, the editor of <i>Wisdom</i>, a popular journal which takes
      all knowledge for its province&mdash;to prove that there is nothing
      physically impossible in the facts deposed to by this witness. He is at
      present suffering, as you see, from a serious accident caused by the very
      machine of which he speaks, and which can be exhibited, with a working
      model, to the Court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It certainly requires corroboration," said the judge. "At present, so far
      as I am aware, it is contrary to scientific experience. You can prove,
      perhaps, that, in the opinion of experts, these machines have only to take
      one step further to become practical modes of locomotion. But <i>that</i>
      is the very step <i>qui coûte</i>. Nothing but direct evidence that the
      step has been taken&mdash;that a flying machine, on this occasion,
      actually <i>flew</i> (they appear to be styled <i>volantes, a non volando</i>)&mdash;would
      really help your case, and establish the credibility of this witness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With your lordship's learned remarks," replied the counsel for the crown,
      "I am not the less ready to agree, because I <i>have</i> an actual
      eye-witness, who not only saw the flight deposed to by the witness, but
      reported it to several persons, who are in court, on the night of its
      occurrence, so that her statement, though disbelieved, was the common talk
      of the neighborhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! that is another matter," said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call Eliza Gullick," said the counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza was called, and in a moment was curtsying, with eagerness, but
      perfect self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      After displaying an almost technical appreciation of the nature of an
      oath, Eliza was asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remember the night of the 7th of February?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember it very well, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you remember it so well, Eliza?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Becos such a mort o' things happened, sir, that night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you tell his lordship what happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, my lord. Mr. Toopny gave us a supper, us himps, my lord, at
      the <i>Hilarity</i>; for he said&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind what he said, tell us what happened as you were coming home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, it was about eleven o'clock at night, and I was turning the
      lane into the <i>Hit or Miss</i>, when I heard an awful flapping and
      hissing and whirring, like wings working by steam, in the waste ground at
      the side of the lane. And, as I was listening&mdash;oh, it frightens me
      now to think of it&mdash;oh, sir&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, don't be alarmed, my good child! What occurred?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great thing like a bird, sir, bigger than a man, flew up over my head,
      higher than the houses. And then&mdash;did you ever see them Japanese
      toys, my lord, them things with two feathers and a bit of India-rubber as
      you twist round and round and toss them up and they fly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my girl, I have seen them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, just as if it had been one of them things settling down, the bird's
      wings turned round and fluttered and shook, and at last it all lighted,
      quite soft like, on the roof of our house, the <i>Hit or Miss</i>. And
      there I saw it crouching when I went to bed, and looked out o' the window,
      but they wouldn't none o' them believe me, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead silence in the Court as Eliza finished this extraordinary
      confirmation of Winter's evidence, and wove the net inextricably round the
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the silence was broken by a soft crashing sound, as if something
      heavy had dropped a short distance on some hard object.
    </p>
    <p>
      All present turned their eyes from staring at Eliza to the place whence
      the sound had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner's head had fallen forward on the railing in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the officers of the Court touched him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not stir. They lifted him. He moved not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faint heart of the man had fluttered with its last pulsation. The
      evidence had sufficed for him without verdict or sentence. As he had slain
      his victim, so Fate slew him, painlessly, in a moment!

      And what became of them all?

    <p>
      He who does not tell, on the plea that he is "competing with Life," which
      never knits up a plot, but leaves all the threads loose, acts unfairly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. St. John Deloraine is now Mrs. Maitland, and the happy couple are
      visiting the great Colonies, seeking a site for a new settlement of the
      unemployed, who should lead happy lives under the peaceful sway of happy
      Mrs. Maitland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barton and Mrs. Barton have practised the endowment of research, in the
      case of Winter, who has quite recovered from his injuries, and still hopes
      to fly. But he has never trusted himself again on his machine, which,
      moreover, has never flown again. Winter, like the alchemist who once made
      a diamond by chance, in Balzac's novel, has never recovered the creative
      moment. But he makes very interesting models, in which Mrs. Barton's
      little boy begins to take a lively interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza Gullick, declining all offers of advancement unconnected with the
      British drama, clings to the profession for which, as Mrs. Gullick
      maintains, she has a hereditary genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We hear," says the <i>Athenæum</i>, "that the long promised edition of
      'Demetrius of Scepsis,' by Mr. Bielby, of St. Gatien's, is in the hands of
      the delegates of the Clarendon Press."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Fiction herself is revolted by the improbability of the statement that
      an Oxford Don has finished his <i>magnum opus!</i>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
